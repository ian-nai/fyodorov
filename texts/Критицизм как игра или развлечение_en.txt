For the “city”, that is, for the so -called “civilization”, Kant's philosophy is the truth itself, moreover, not tragic, but very comforting. Having made sure of the impotence of the mind, torn into the theoretical and practical, the “city” with the blessing of Kant can with a calm conscience to indulge in all kinds of games, artistic and manufactory, the fun of the creations of lifeless similarities (images and shells - clothes, decorations), instead of the recreation of living entities. (But to get involved in similarities and toys is characteristic of children; that is why) Kant's “criticism” refers to the state of minority, which, however, does not realize Kant. In criticism of judgments, that is, the judgment of aesthetic, the following definition of the aesthetic state is given: “This state is the lack of practical needs and practical indifference - the state of the game, pure, playing contemplation.” Free from all kinds of (ideological and business) relations, “pure” beauty can (from this point of view) find in flowers, in arabesques, in an idyllic nature. “Free” beauty can be found where there is only a game of forms that puts sensitivity in a harmonious attitude to thinking. “Everything exalted plunges us, like sensitive creatures, to dust, in order to raise us as higher as rational creatures (? !!). In the elevated there is always something akin to a gigantic fate that exalts a person, crushing him. ”
