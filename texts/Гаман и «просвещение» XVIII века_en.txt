Speaking about the Gamanic metaphorical resurrection, we cannot at all put this “beautiful” German thinker above the so -called “enlightenment” contemporary to him, the enemy of which he had the courage to be. For these salon philosophers, the highest pleasure and almost the main task was to laugh at human stupidity; And under stupidity, they understood neither more nor less, like all religions, that is, the cult of the fathers, the highest manifestation of which should be universal resurrection, which is only a metaphor for Haman. Going in this way with his opponents in the final and main conclusion, he, in essence, stands no higher than them, but, without noticing it, at the same level with them in the most important one, despite all the difference in the secondary.

These “philosophers” reduced a person to the level of the animal, to the plant (“L’ Homme-Plante”-one of the works of the Golbakhov circle), to the machine (L’ Homme-Machine Lametri), that is, deprived a person of all dignity. True, others, French sages, people of "sensitive virtue", Russo and Co., "returned to humanity the title of human dignity." We do not want to put Gaman below these restorers of human greatness, but we are forced to indicate that in this case, both the loss of dignity was imaginary and its return was fictitious, then and the other because the very concept of all these reverers of “natural” humanity about its dignity was false. In fact, what genuine dignity can a rational being, which is completely dependent on the blind nature of nature and does not do anything to free itself on this yoke, which caused so many losses, the story of which is a history, so lifelessly beloved by the Haman? ..
