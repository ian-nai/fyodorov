In “Criticism of the Pure Reason,” the mind remained faithful to its definition, that is, he remained with knowledge idle, for which he was awarded ignorance. The practical mind turned out to be incorrect to its definition and therefore awarded faith. The third mind was awarded only the name of judgment, although all three minds are engaged only in judgments: 1st-judgments about thoughts, the second-judgments about affairs, or rather, divisions of people who do not know and therefore engaged only in squabbles; The third mind, artistic, is busy with judgments about the likenesses created by the figures of these squabbles, and the reproduction of the creatures of the Force devoid of reason, thanks to the unreasonable and idle of rational creatures, at least the creatures of the Stone, who attempted to create, but did not make themselves like the creator to recreate his creations.

But if the cognition had not been taken into the monopoly property of only the estate condemned for thinking idle, then the subject of the first mind would not have the thought of thought, but the thought of the case, that is, the draft of universal business; And the second mind, practical, would be the fulfillment of the universal business, while the third as the creation of similarities would be the introduction in the second, creating models of what should be recreated by the second, business mind with the help of knowledge granted to the first. The third mind, in order not to be only the judgment of teleological, should not look for miracles in nature, not to know only the expediency, which, however, Kant considers it impossible; He must introduce expediency into the world and to life that the city, burgher professor remains completely incomprehensible.
