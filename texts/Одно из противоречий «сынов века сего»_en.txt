Our time is at the age of relay and age of retrospectiveness. In morality, in private and family life, as in politics and in a civilian life, in a word, in life we ​​renounce the past, servile before the present; And in the discord and struggle of children with the fathers, we are for children (at least), we are against fathers; We are conscious, convinced and praised by this rupture of renegades. And at the same time, we build, like the Pharisees, elegant tombs to the fathers: more zealous than when - liba, we write biographies, history and criticism (or rather, only critics under the guise of stories and biographies!); With zeal, sometimes amazing, we dig in petty investigations of the past, what we do not believe in, which we do not value and do not love! ..

The preceding generations contemplated God and nature face to face; We want to see them only with the eyes of their predecessors. Why don't we put ourselves in a direct attitude towards the Universe and its Creator? Why is the poetry and philosophy of internal, penetrating personal vision, and not one legend, who was dead for us, not to have a living religion that has been taken by humanity through direct revelation, and not through memories, through only history? Why is this impossible for us? - Because we love only ourselves and because we are liar! The revelations of the god of fathers who are exalted over the fathers are not enough; And in the break with the fathers, do not know the god of fathers, the true God! .. We do not want to resurrect their fathers, we decorate the tombs of them, we rejoice their deaths, and then we send them a blasphemy under the guise of biographies ...
