(Regarding the book by V. S. Solovyov "Justification of Good")
1

Solovyov should have called his large work not a justification of good, but a complete condemnation and denial of vice alone, because the highest positive good is only resurrection, i.e. the return of life by sons to fathers, and the immortal life that follows from this. Chicherin discusses Solovyov's work from a zoo-anthropic point of view, but it is necessary and even impossible not to make comments on it from the point of view of theo-anthropic morality. To refute the first, that is, Solovyov, and to supplement, making some changes in the critical remarks of the second, that is, Chicherin, is undertaken by an unlearned person, but educated by the service of the Passion Days and Easter Matins, as an expression of the highest morality,<<3>> which must be preceded by forty days of repentance for sins common to all: in culture, that is, suicide, in artificial extinction, in civilization, or mutual extermination, and in the exploitation or depletion of nature.

Shame, compassion, justice, identified by Soloviev with compassion, and reverence make up the entire range of Soloviev's moral concepts, whereas according to the Gospel, one should place childish, filial and daughterly love at the foundation, love without fear and lust, without identifying it with reverence, without placing it below compassion and shame, and certainly without attributing to animals that feeling which outlives childhood and which manifests itself in remembrance, so that even death itself does not set an end to it. Shame, compassion, justice - this is only the denial of evil, and not the recognition of good, which consists in turning the sensual, blind, deadly force acting both in us and outside of us into one controlled by the collective, all-human reason, as a life-giving instrument of God, destroying vice at the root and establishing the fullness of good; whereas modern morality, although it also consists in the struggle against evil, is a struggle in isolation, not diminishing evil by an iota.

On the path of turning blind, deadly force into one controlled by reason (sensuous and insensible force into one that feels and therefore enlivens), which is the fundamental task of a moral and rational being, i.e. the realization of good, truth and beauty, in a word, the Kingdom of God, on this direct royal path, shame is only an indication of a deviation from the true direction, of a backward movement, of a distortion of knowledge and action in conception and birth and in the preceding process of preparation for conception, expressed in an indefinite desire to move away from parents and kinship. Shame is an expression of betrayal of the fathers, a violation of the duty of resurrection, a conversion of the will into lust. In conception and birth, physical necessity is expressed, in shame, moral necessity. The fruit of this deviation is a new being, which must traverse the same path that has already been traversed by the one who has deviated or stopped on the path to truth and good.<<4>> Knowledge guided by shame should, by the combined efforts of the entire human race as a being already united and not in discord, illuminate this internal, retrograde process (which it is already partly doing) and give it an opposite direction (which it does not yet even think about): not to reproduce the similar from its lowest stage, but to restore for conscious, higher life the real, the former, the suffering, the thirsting for life and the dead. Shame, therefore, indicates the violation of the first two commandments, i.e., the creation of likenesses instead of real restoration and the submission of oneself to blind, sensual force; in other words, the recognition of another power, another God, besides the One Omniscient, Almighty, Whom we must serve with our whole being. The beginning of sin, half involuntary for those who give birth and completely involuntary for the one being born, coincides with the beginning of intrauterine life; already from that time on, the violation of the first two commandments begins, leading to death. Together with growth and development, the alienation of the one being born from the parental being begins, an alienation accompanied even by the illness of the mother, the condolences of the parent, if they (i.e., both parents) have become one flesh and spirit, i.e., the violation of the fifth commandment also begins. In a word, shame indicates mortification and requires resurrection.

But this deviation is not an absolute evil, an evil in essence, for this being born is a new being, whose existence is not accidental, but necessary. It should have appeared in another way, not by blind conception and birth, but by that which is indicated in the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, in the birth of the son and the procession of the Holy Spirit, because for the perfection of life, plurality is as necessary as unity. Man is not born of lust alone; mother and father can remain virgins even after birth, ever-sons and ever-daughters, and must even become more and more so, because this is the condition of resurrection.

Embryonic development, considered from the moral side as an involuntary original sin, may seem like a repetition of the crime committed in the animal kingdom, when it changed from a herbivorous to a predatory one and even when it acquired sexual organs ana, which meant, in addition to the perpetuation of carnivory, i.e. murder for the predator, also suicide for anyone giving birth. Being born, separating itself and thereby, as it were, refusing life with everyone for everyone, refusing out of ignorance, it, this blind creature, out of improvidence, i.e. also out of blindness, refused what it had to do with all the living for all the dead. In embryonic life, the fetus acquired organs for life with everyone and for everyone; if the stomach means life for itself, and the genitals are life for others, then the chest and head mean life with everyone and for everyone, with all the living and for all the dead; the chest (heart) is the organ of grief and compassion for the dead and dying, and the head is the bearer of the project of resurrection. The retrograde internal process is repeated in the external world: the ashes of the ancestors are converted into food for the descendants, and are not returned to the ancestors, are not recreated in their bodies. The joy of the peasant at the harvest, the joy of the mother at the birth of a child are understandable; but Solovyov, apparently, does not recognize even that small share of joy that the mother feels, bringing into the world a creature that bears only a distant resemblance to herself. This joy is only a weak hint at the joy of resurrection, when a creature is reproduced that is capable of responding in full reciprocity, giving full satisfaction to intellectual, moral and especially artistic needs. The process of conception cannot be recognized as sacred, divine, as the pagans and their humanist followers do; but it cannot be recognized as sinful, demonic, as ascetics and eunuchs recognize it. Rejecting birth, Solovyov does not recognize resurrection either. Shame for him is the highest, the only virtue that animals do not have. Man, he could say, is a blushing creature; man is created by blood flowing from the lower organs to the higher. By making shame a subject of pride, Solovyov deprived it of fruitfulness. Not to give birth is not yet a virtue. Birth, as a general property of blind nature, is accompanied by illness and death - also a general property of blind nature, causing in a rational being not only sympathy and compassion, but also redemption from all evils and with it - the joy of deliverance. Christianity expressed all the virtues (shame, compassion, redemption) not in a negative form, but in all their fullness and greatness in the service of Holy Week and Easter Day, which will be clear from what follows. Shame here is not limited to the denial of vice. Soloviev apparently did not focus his attention on that great woman, on the chaste harlot, that heroine of the central day of Holy Week—Great Wednesday—on that harlot who not only renounced sexual passion, mourning her fall with bitter tears, but also used that myrrh which at the feast of life serves to strengthen destructive sexual passion and for sexual selection, to prepare for burial, the meaning of which is resurrection, and not just memento mori.<<5>> Soloviev did not focus his attention on the great woman of Great Wednesday, because he does not attach any significance to the rite at all; and yet the rite is the product of all the pious faculties of the entire people, whereas dogma is the product only of thought, and moreover the thought of only a few. Dogma only confirms the already established rite, only seeks out a foundation for it (in the realm of religious thought). The refutation, or rather the ignoring of the ritual, succeeds only temporarily. The ritual can be replaced only by deeds. That is why Protestantism, as a replacement of the ritual only by thought, can only hold out temporarily.

For Solovyov, who recognizes only compassion, but does not recognize any sympathetic joy, suffering dies together with the Great Sufferer on Good Friday. For him, the day of suffering is followed by an unevening day of rest, Saturday or nirvana, and not by labor leading to an unevening day of resurrection. But anyone who has ever been to Easter matins cannot help but know the feeling of sympathetic joy; anyone who sympathized with the Crucified on Good Friday, anyone who was buried with Him on Holy Saturday, cannot help but be resurrected with Him, “I have resurrected Him.” This is sympathetic joy, which the philosopher could not understand, much less his critic, the lawyer.

To the two negative virtues, Soloviev adds a third, even more limited negative one—justice, which he combines with compassion, diverging in this case from Chicherin, who, as a lawyer in essence, understands it in the narrowest and strictly legal sense, i.e. as a virtue that wants to destroy evil with evil, punishes murder with murder, thus resulting in two murders. Resurrection is the atonement for the sin of murder; and more or less everyone is guilty of this sin, if we recognize in the Gospel sense that every harsh word is already a death, even if slow. Secular truth punished Him Who, contrary to the law of blind nature, which condemned Lazarus to death, returned him to life; having punished love, evil truth thereby condemned itself. “Great is the day” is the triumph of love over truth. The word of Chrysostom, pronounced on this day, is the announcement of a universal amnesty; it forces us to recognize Easter not only as the week of the workers of the 11th hour, i.e. late evening, who received pay equal to those who worked from early morning, but even more - as an expression of the meaning contained in the parables of the drachma lost and found, of the lost and returned sheep; and their meaning is that the joy of Easter is the joy of the return of the last sinner, i.e. of universal salvation. This is both joy and gratitude (Eucharist) unceasing, boundless, gratitude of all who have come to life to the eternally living God.

In Passion Week and in Easter, taken in one day, a complete moral code is written in this way, i.e. a plan or project of resurrection, and it is repeated in a weakened form <<6>> in the other 50 weeks and especially in the weeks of the two Triodions, which have deep moral and educational significance; so that moral teaching merges not only with dogmatic (dogma becomes a commandment), but also with the ritual itself, as an external expression of dogma and commandment, i.e. dogmatic, scholastic theology, is united not only with the moral, vital, but also (if one can put it this way) with the aesthetic; school is united with the temple, preparing for extra-temple work, or for the conversion of cemeteries into fortresses that do not only protect the ashes of the fathers, but must also revive them, which turns them from places of burial into places of resurrection by the combined forces of all. The fifty-fold repetition of the rite in such a threefold manifestation (i.e. the experience of all the virtues: repentance for every impure thought (Wednesday), brotherhood at the memorial meal (Thursday), compassion (Friday), co-dying (Saturday), co-rejoicing in the resurrection (Sunday)) has a pedagogical goal - to transform the old man into the son of man for the fulfillment of the duty of resurrection... But the rite without the corresponding extra-temple work also turns out to be powerless to transform extra-temple life. How can we eliminate the contradiction between the temple service and the life outside the temple?..

Between the educational significance of the Jewish week and Holy Week, combined with Sunday, there is a whole abyss: the fourth Old Testament commandment, as the Jews understood it, required that they serve the true God only one day, "7>> and that mentally, or imaginarily, i.e. serve by inaction; but for six days it allowed them to actually serve, by deeds, false gods: Mercury, Mars, Venus, i.e. personal lusts and benefits, which in trade and industry receive their fullest disuniting expression, and in agriculture least of all, for rain and fair weather unite in a common desire, although not yet in a common deed. The educational power of the Christian week leads, in contrast to the civilization and culture of the pagan and Jewish-Mohammedan, not from the village to the city, but from the city to the village. The Jewish week of six days of discord and one-day unification in inaction, in peace, while the Christian week, the Passion Week, turning into a Passion Week, i.e. into a work week, begins precisely with an indication of the disasters and sufferings that await the world if unification does not take place. The first two days lead to the consciousness of the evil of discord. (Even “decadence,” one might say, serves as an expression of this consciousness). Wednesday is the turn from discord to unification; Thursday gathers all the living at the memorial meal, produces an upsurge, elevates feelings and thoughts to the mountain, from where, already contemplating the fulfillment of the duty of resurrection, it performs the Eucharist, thanksgiving. This Wednesday of the day, the noon of the work day, the liturgy. The day of suffering. Friday, strengthens the union by compassion; compassion is manifested on Saturday instead of rest in the work of resurrection, completing the union; in short, the Christian week, in contrast to the Jewish week, is a union for resurrection. <<8»

If the day of rest, of inaction, is replaced by a day of orgies, we get a pagan week. In other days it does not differ from the European one, and the new Europe has preserved this cult in the present names of the days of the week, and has turned Sunday into a day of rest in England, and in other countries into a day of play, feasts, amusements, as among the ancients. Islam has turned even the day of suffering into a day of rejoicing. The Buddhist week would require the transformation of all seven days into one Saturday, into inaction, into nirvana, while Christianity requires the transformation of all days into resurrection, as if into one “non-evening day”. The Christian week is a natural replacement and completion of paganism, Judaism, Mohammedanism and Buddhism, i.e., all the main religions of the world. When every day of the week everywhere awakens those feelings and thoughts that are awakened by the services during the days of Passion Week and Easter Week, then the unification of all in thought and feeling, one can say, has begun, has begun for the fulfillment of the duty of resurrection in reality. True, the annual fifty-fold repetition of the Pascha of the Cross and the Resurrection for almost nineteen centuries has not yet converted people into the sons of men, has not united them in the work of resurrection; but this great instrument (repeated liturgical repetition) will only receive fruitful application when the goal is set, when the work for which people are called. This will be the coming of age of the human race. And why should this tool be used if man has no goal, no great cause for which it would be necessary to unite? When the goal is discovered, i.e. recognized, then this great tool of theoanthropic (God-human or God-father and God-son) morality will need to be given the opportunity for universal dissemination.

This opportunity is revealed in three projects: 1) in the project of the widespread construction of schools-temples (which means the combination of the school - dogmatic - with the ritual) for the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the relics of the Venerator of the Holy Trinity; 2) in the project of universally obligatory knowledge and, finally, 3) in the project of converting kremlins, that is, central and local cemeteries, which, with universal military service, are to become fortresses, into institutions that will serve not only for defense against their own kind, but for turning the deadly force of nature into a reviving one, that is, they will serve for external and internal regulation.

HOLY WEEK IN LIFE

Holy Week as an expression of religiosity and theo-anthropic morality in contrast to zoo-anthropic, replacing God with blind, parricidal, sensual force and the learned-class right of prodigal sons.

Abstract dogma is powerless; it receives its strength only in the ritual that is so despised today. But Soloviev does not recognize ritual, i.e., the union of the moral with the dogmatic and aesthetic, at least judging by the way Chicherin presents the matter. "Mr. Soloviev," he says, "wants to construct his moral philosophy not only independently of any positive religion, but also without resorting to theoretical philosophy or metaphysics." Chicherin approves of the first and condemns the second. But the first, contrary to Chicherin, is completely incomprehensible and incorrect, if religion is the cult of God-fathers, and morality is love for God and the fathers, from which brotherhood follows by itself. Brotherhood as a basis, as a demand for the right to well-being for all, is the most evil mockery, if measures are not taken to ensure what is necessary for everyone; and we will have such security only in external regulation. As for the second (the construction of a moral philosophy without resorting to theoretical or metaphysics), this is both necessary and possible, for first it is necessary for everyone to know what the moral work and the common duty of all consists of. Soloviev, however, starting with the vague concept of man instead of the son of man, really renounces religion and falls into metaphysics. Religion is common to all, but philosophy is the property of the class of those people who have abandoned the work and have become only thinkers. The class of scientists and thinkers is temporary, not eternal, unless the human race is condemned to remain forever in the present miserable state, when some are doomed to inaction, and others to ignorance; and the end of such a deplorable disunity, a complete denial of kinship, is already approaching. However, metaphysics can also become religious when it gives reason a meaning that is not only subjective, but also not only objective, but projective, when the universal matter becomes the solution to the question of knowledge, when natural knowledge, the representation of the sons of the fathers becomes a real resurrection. Every person knows himself to be the son of his mother and father, the grandson of his grandfather, the descendant of ancestors whom he no longer sees, i.e., he recognizes them as dead. He knows death from direct observation, as an eyewitness, from the testimony of others and from tradition. In each such case, he (i.e., everyone) imagines the dampness of the grave, and the worms, etc., in a word, he experiences with the deceased the entire process of death and decomposition, i.e., he dies and is buried with him (this is Friday and Saturday). But at the same time, he (everyone) is also the one who buries; the act of burial shows that the one who buries does not recognize the full reality of death and cannot refuse the return of full, real life (resurrection) to the deceased, because burial is basically nothing other than opposition to death (albeit powerless), and the return of life (albeit invalid). Burial indicates that in the sons of deceased fathers there lives an ineradicable need for resurrection. The sons of deceased fathers resist death as long as their strength allows; and strength depends on the volume and degree of knowledge and on the unification for its use in action. The sons resist even with the current insignificance of knowledge, which is also directed in the other direction. A coffin, a burial vault is needed so that the stepmother - "damp earth" does not touch the deceased; i.e., the sons resist this decomposition.<<9>> The sons also mark the place where they bury their father and mother. This is not enough: having arranged a place for the dead, as for the living, they nevertheless do not consider their work finished; they cannot reconcile themselves to the removal of their fathers and the dead in general, which is why they call this removal burial (a Sabbath deed). Having hidden in the ground out of physical necessity, the sons, out of moral (family) necessity, immediately bring the hidden one out of the grave, immediately restore him, erecting a monument or, as far as they can, a likeness of the deceased o (this is an artistic resurrection). Each monument is an expression of a single resurrection, and a temple is the general resurrection of many. Such skill is art and knowledge, more closely - science, even more closely - philosophy. We do not know the boundaries of either one or the other (knowledge and art), and are not obliged to set boundaries for them, for only resurrection gives meaning to both science and art, uniting them into one thing; only resurrection resolves all the contradictions contained in them. Burial and interment in the sense of resurrection give a person the purpose and meaning of life. In order (not) to be afraid of death for oneself, as happens with those who have lost the meaning of life, one must experience with others the entire destructive process of death. The son resists, buries his father, i.e. protects him from the destructive force, because he cannot help but imagine behind this force a Being, indestructible, immortal, Whose instrument he makes himself, struggling with the destructive, deadly force, and Whose likeness he (the son) is in the burial (i.e. in the resurrection). Even before the burial, the resistance to death or preparation for the burial begins: the conciliar reading, the initiation into immortal life, and the last rites during the agony - all this is a repetition of Holy Wednesday, Thursday and Friday in individual cases. Then the funeral service begins, which is repeated and will continue until the unification for the real resurrection takes place...

In exactly the same way, Soloviev falls into metaphysics, saying that morality presupposes relations with other people. If Solovyov had substituted the living concept of “son of man” for the abstract concept of “man,” then these “others” would have turned out to be fathers, parents, and the Father of fathers, and therefore not at all other, not alien, but one’s own, whom one should not separate from oneself, just as the Father of fathers was not alien, not different for the Son of Man, and at the same time for the Son of God. The other, as it should be, would have become for Solovyov what we call nature, which through various deprivations brought man to consciousness, thanks to which he very early recognized that God is not in nature, but with us; and having recognized nature as “other,” he immediately recognized that behind it there is also something of one’s own, not another. But nature also remains other, hostile, deadly only because of the inaction and discord of its own, and nature is only a temporary enemy, but an eternal friend. 3
THE FOUNDATIONS OF MORALITY OR THE DUTY OF RESURRECTION

Soloviev's mistake (of course, if we ourselves are not mistaken) is precisely in this; and it consists in the fact that from the very beginning he did not reject the artificially abstract, indefinite, empty concept of "man" and did not put in its place the concept of "son of man", full of meaning and feeling, i.e. the son not only of living but also of dead fathers, in whom the duty of sons is given, the duty of resurrection is given. There is uncertainty and emptiness, here - boundless breadth and depth! Together with the recognition of people as sons, fatherland and brotherhood are given, and everything legal, economic and socialist is rejected as base. Not only the legal concept and the names "citizen" and "citizenship", now so loud and glorified, and which have replaced "brother" and "brotherhood" are rejected; Not only the economic concepts of master and mercenary, which have replaced the concepts of father and son, have been rejected, but also the socialist concept of association, partnership, based on the participation of each in the profits. A citizen is not a brother, a mercenary is not a son, a master is not a father, partnership is not a brotherhood. All this is impure in that morality which recognizes only kinship, so that it would be a great mistake to assume that the most ideal constructions of socialist societies are impossible, unrealizable because people are not angels. Just the opposite! They are unrealizable because people are not angels!

Inseparable from the recognition of men as sons is, as its basis, the concept or idea of ​​God as triune, expressing the purest kinship, so that it is impious even to speak of the origin of the idea of ​​God, but one can and should speak only of alienation and even more - of betrayal of the fathers and the God of the fathers, whence comes the denial of God, which is only a theoretical expression of practical alienation, betrayal - a denial possible only in prodigal sons or citizens, masters, mercenaries, fellow profiteers. Reverence, or more precisely and truly, filial and daughterly love (without lust and fear) must be placed at the basis of everything moral, intellectual and artistic, and not ask, in accordance with Chicherin: “10>> “is it possible to affirm this principle as a generally binding moral rule along with the principles of asceticism and altruism?”<<11>> Meanwhile, brotherhood, flowing from the relationship to the fathers, stands incomparably higher than both asceticism and altruism, for it requires life not for oneself and not for others only, but with all the living for all the dead, i.e. the duty of resurrection. And this duty requires not abstinence, not asceticism, but the replacement of birth with resurrection. For the sons of dead fathers or ancestors, what is due is undoubtedly at the same time desirable, their own, easily and necessarily revealed by the sons; and therefore there is no need for a new prophet, much less for a new Messiah, and a new only begotten son is completely impossible God's.<<12» Although Soloviev speaks only of the prophet, the path from him to the Messiah is not closed and may threaten new discord. In our opinion, the prophetic spirit will act not in one, but in all sons and daughters, as the prophet foresaw this in the Old Testament: love for the fathers will prompt the sons why a gathering and unification of all is necessary; but Soloviev does not recognize, apparently, the age of majority even in the last, highest period of life, which he calls prophetic, which means a return to the Old Testament imperfection. People (and not sons) remain in darkness, need a prophet. Is a new revelation really needed to replace the words "be perfect" with the words "be perfect", i.e. to replace the plural with the singular, for the addition "do not desire" and "be and be" is, of course, only an explanation. What is needed, therefore, is not a prophet, but a commentator. But in this substitution of the plural for the singular lies, in our opinion, the error. Not only "have good will, be honest, be virtuous," but also "be painless, immortal, incorruptible" - that means: "be a Westerner, put personality above all else, be Faust, listen to Mephistopheles"! Immortality, therefore, first of all, and resurrection (if only Solovyov recognizes it) only then; and even then, resurrection only separately! This is no longer altruism, but egoism, for first you yourself must become immortal, and only then do so that your neighbors become painless, immortal, incorruptible. Note - "neighbors", and not fathers, i.e. we are talking about the immortality of the living, and not about the resurrection of the dead; as if to become personally, and especially individually, immortal were incomparably easier than to achieve universal resurrection! Soloviev did not add or subtract a single word from the Gospel commandment, but only changed its grammatical form, and something incongruous came out. He, of course, does not recognize, as was said above, that one must live not for oneself and not for others, but with everyone and for everyone... Now it is clear that Soloviev does not have a duty of resurrection; resurrection for him is not a virtue; and recognizing resurrection as a virtue, we must also recognize its moral obligation, recognize resurrection as a duty. Resurrection and moral perfection are identical; therefore, to improve ourselves by collective efforts means that each person must overcome vices not in himself only separately, but at their very root, in the causes, in the blind force of nature. This means uniting in the work of understanding the blind force of nature, which carries in itself not only hunger, plague and death, but also produces all vices. This kind of unification is the brotherhood whose duty is resurrection. Not to identify perfection with resurrection (i.e. with the conversion of the born into the re-created, of what is happening by itself into what is controlled by reason) means to leave perfection indefinite, to desire special leisure for it. When perfection is identified with resurrection, the demand for rest will be equivalent to a pause in the matter of returning life to the fathers and acquiring immortality for oneself, it will be a demand for death in relation to the relatives of the entire human race.<<13>>

ON TWO LABOR AND TWO THOUGHTS OR DIRECTIONS

On the question of labor or vain labor and work of decay (i.e. on the question of exhausting labor and rest; on black, monotonous, mechanical work and on leisure for mental and artistic amusement, for entertainment, for festive orgies) and on the matter of resurrection, native to all sons.

On two thoughts and directions: a) according to one - the world is the idea of ​​each, i.e. each recognizes the reality of only his own existence and the illusory or ghostly existence of others, accepting his dependence and slavery to the external world for dominion; b) in another direction - recognition of dependence on the external world, expressed in losses, leads to the project of returning losses. Brotherhood and fatherland receive their full expression in the unification of the living for the resurrection of the dead, in the unification of all sons without division and without fusion for the return of life to the fathers. The connection between the unification of the living and the resurrection of the dead, i.e. the connection of those who received life with those from whom they received it, is absolutely necessary. This is a moral and natural life. Not to revive the dead means for the living to condemn themselves to moral inaction, to kill themselves, to fail to fulfill an unconditional demand. (Is it not equally pointless to merely mortify oneself (asceticism) and to merely support the lives of others, doomed to death (altruism)?) And such demands as, for example, that every person should have secure means of subsistence, sufficient physical rest and be able to use leisure time for his spiritual perfection, prove that Soloviev does not recognize the work of resurrection, as containing everything in itself, or the Kingdom of God, but next to it places the kingdom of this world, for civilization, culture, exploitation of nature are mutual extermination, self-destruction and exhaustion of nature, i.e. the work of mortification instead of resurrection, the kingdom of this world instead of the Kingdom of God. Soloviev preaches the right to well-being, as if outside the debt of resurrection can be well-being! The Kingdom of God, giving the highest well-being, excludes all misfortune. To speak of rest, i.e. of limiting the work, which is resurrection, to eight, seven, six hours, etc. up to zero hours, means turning rest into punishment, since this would be a requirement that a person limit himself in the most essential and beloved work, which is his own, native to each, and at the same time universal. To speak of leisure for perfection, recognizing resurrection as a universal work, would be an obvious inconsistency, because resurrection, i.e. the conversion of the born, the self-producing, into the reproduced, is already perfection itself. It is obvious that the burning contemporary question of the relation of workers to capitalists has prompted the philosopher, out of sympathy for the oppressed, to demand for everyone the right to well-being, i.e., to security in the means of existence and to sufficient physical rest, to leisure for moral improvement. This presupposes that both capitalists and workers will exist forever, i.e., that there will never be a union for resurrection. And yet only the duty of resurrection, expressed in regulation, can provide a peaceful solution to the terrible question; not socialism, but only natural science, if it is not an appendix to the production of objects that arouse enmity, if it does not arm this enmity with weapons of destruction and devotes itself entirely to the work of regulation—only natural science can lead to a peaceful solution of the question. The work of resurrection does not flow from sympathy for the oppressed workers, not from hatred for the oppressing capitalists, but from sorrow over the discord. In other words, it does not come from social pauperism, but from natural weakness, from the natural imperfection of human nature, common to both, i.e., from its mortality, and also from contempt for the very objects that cause discord. The work of resurrection even abolishes the question of the distribution of goods, turning to the very root of discord, and - what is most remarkable - resolves the question of the distribution of goods without having it in mind at all. Deploring discord, despising its very object, i.e., not objects of need, but toys produced by manufacture, articles of luxury, indicating our immaturity, the human race, or the union of armed peoples, turning into a force of natural science, acting according to one common plan, from the very first steps in the work of resurrection begins with the regulation of the meteoric process, thereby ensuring daily bread for everyone without exception. Therefore, the extension of military service should not sadden us, for it is a necessary condition for the unification of regulation, which makes harvests independent of the accidents of the weather, and at the same time, as a necessary consequence of regulation, distributes the solar power to each village and hamlet, turning factory production into a handicraft, family industry, receiving from heaven the working capital for production."14>> Then the accumulation of population, i.e., sons who have left the land of their fathers, in the cities will become unnecessary. Thanks to regulation, the arduous extraction of power from the depths of the earth will also become unnecessary. This power will be obtained from the atmosphere. Metals mined by hard labor from deep mines will no longer be needed; they will be replaced by metals of meteoric or cosmic origin, attracted from heavenly space by regulating the attractive force of the earth, assuming that, probably, in this way the reserves of metals also arose in the earth's crust itself. People, thus freed from economic necessity to gather in cities, i.e., prodigal sons, will have a vast field to apply their combined activity in agricultural labor, in the matter of restoring the life of their dead fathers and thereby ensuring their existence, no longer temporary, but eternal.<<*1"

1 On two moralities: the theo-anthropic, or the duty of universal resurrection, and the zoo-anthropic, or the right to personal enjoyment (without labor, without fulfilling the duty of resurrection), i.e., the right to well-being, rest and leisure. But with the fraternal unification of those living for the resurrection of their dead fathers and ancestors, where will private misfortune come from? Why will there be a need for rest when there are no exploiters of labor? For what kind of perfection will leisure be needed when resurrection includes all-round perfection?<<2>> The implementation of resurrection (beginning with the first unification in the work of deliverance from hunger, plague and death) will destroy the current capitalist economy and the proletariat without any violence.

The duty of resurrection cannot be only a subject of ethics, for it includes all aesthetics and all knowledge. If Solovyov says that nature is indifferent and merciless, and we are supposedly not responsible for this, and even adds: “of course we are not responsible,” then he obviously does not recognize the theoretical basis of the duty of resurrection, does not recognize that if God created a blind force, and therefore merciless, then He also created a rational one, and therefore the second, feeling one, is responsible for all the evil done by the first, merciless one, reasonable, compassionate. God did not create blindness.

Be like children ("as children in purpose"). Integrity is a property of children. For a child, the thought of the dead is not separated from the feeling, from the love for them, and therefore resurrection cannot but become a duty for them. "Be like children" means: be "as children in purpose". Doves; in the expression of Christ, equivalent to children. Not to separate, but to unite the knowledge of the serpent, the devil, with the angelic, childish feeling means to be like children. For those who have preserved integrity, the separation of faith and knowledge would be the greatest evil.

2 If the right to enjoyment were replaced by the duty to limit enjoyment as much as possible, this would not contradict the cause of resurrection.

3 The lowest morality comes from "Know thyself", i.e. know only thyself, not recognizing the testimony of the brothers, i.e. all others, nor tradition, i.e. the testimony of the fathers; the lowest morality recognizes only personal consciousness as the only reliable source. Christ in the Gospel of John rejects personal testimony and points to the deed as the most reliable testimony.

4 By giving his firstborn the name of his father or mother, the son, who has submitted to physiological necessity, expresses in this name a psychological, moral necessity, although only nominally, and not really returning life.

5 In the duty of resurrection, both "memento mori" as a regrettable fact and "memento vivere" as a necessary, inevitable goal are combined. Woman, the queen of the industrial world, renounces the role of the temptress who made sons forget their fathers, and opens the way to fraternalization, which is accomplished at the Last Supper.

6 In the least weakened form, this code is repeated in the New Jerusalem; there it represents the greatest educational force. Good Friday in the New Jerusalem is constant, and Easter is every Sunday. If Orthodoxy (i.e. religion) is identified with the Passover of suffering and the Passover of resurrection, then such identification is most understandable precisely in the New Jerusalem.

The New and Old Jerusalem temples are a kuvuklia to which a church is attached. All our temples are churches without a kuvuklia (earlier cemeteries replaced kuvuklia). For those who were in Jerusalem, our temples must seem like extensions, parts that do not yet have the main building. In the same way, the liturgy of the resurrection without the Easter matins before it seems to me to be something unfinished.

7 The fourth commandment had great significance, but temporary, while slave labor and vain, that is, superfluous work existed, not caused by either physical or moral necessity.

8 The Jews abused the leniency of the fourth commandment, especially when they turned from a people living in the ashes of their ancestors into a landless class (without a fatherland), who not even with their thoughts, but only with their lips, honored the God of their fathers, but with all their thoughts, with all their hearts, served the golden calf. The Jews constituted the most godless in reality and the most pious in appearance corporation. But if the Jews sincerely, with all their thoughts, served the true God one day, they could not really serve false gods on other days. The Christian question requires a resolution of the contradiction between the festive thought of God and the everyday service of false gods.

9 … Except perhaps for those who have distorted every kinship feeling in themselves - the rationalist Molokans and others like them, the most empty of all sects.

10 Nothing expresses the zooanthropic nature of Chicherin's concept of morality so much as the expression: "and when reason develops, dependence ceases." In fact, it does not cease even with the death of parents, but only changes; with the death of parents, it even intensifies.

11 The ascetic altruist desires and gives to others what he does not desire for himself, considers low for himself.

12 The prophet in Solovyov is a representative of the zemstvo. Does he not want to make the prophet the successor of the holy fools of ancient Russia, which can be called a monarchy limited by holy fools? In what relationship will the prophet be to science? With the prophet, mystical knowledge enters the life of the human race; but is there room in Solovyov for non-mystical knowledge?

13 The work of resurrection transforms the hard labor of the mining and monotonous factory work into rural agricultural labor, supporting life in the living and returning life to the departed through the study and management of the life process, working in us and outside of us.

14 The transformation of the factory, urban into handicraft, rural business is the transition from the production of luxury goods to the production of necessities.
