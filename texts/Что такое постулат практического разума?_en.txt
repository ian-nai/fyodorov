Why did Kant, who replaced knowledge of Vera in the person of a practical mind, “criticism of practical mind” led to denial and reason and deeds, and remained with one dead faith?

The postulate there is a situation that, although not proved, is accepted (nevertheless) for the truth, in view of theoretical or practical goals, is, therefore, to faith. But the practical mind, requiring the recognition of true freedom, the actual immortality, the real being of God, will be faithful and not dead only when it will have a matter with its proof and, moreover, a common matter. People who recognize the dominance over themselves by the blind power, converting it to it, as deadly, in controlled by the human mind and human will, can these people recognize their autonomy, their freedom for true? And, on the contrary, how can they not recognize the reality of their immortality, when the mortal force of nature will be turned into the life-giving, when a person is free from attachment to the earth, liberated? .. Fulfillment by a universal business, the work of the will of our God, our father, cannot already be heteronomy, that is, alienation: it will already be patronomy, and it is true autonomy, for the language of love is the language of love He says: "We are in you, and you are in us."
