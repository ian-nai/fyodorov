The majestic title “on the other side of good and evil”, of course, is only mistakenly delivered by the author who does not know the road abroad at all the current miserable good and very large evil. Having expelled the first and strengthening the latter, he found complete satisfaction. The real title of his work, really corresponding to his meaning, the author, this half-man, placed at the end of his essay, calling him “evil thoughts”.

The desire of a person on the other side of good and evil was born with a person; Just do not mix the subject of this desire with the so-called "in-hand of being." This desire wishes the new sky and the new earth, that is, the eradication of evil and the placement of the good. But we do not find this in the dreams of Nietzsche: in the superman, he restores old vices. The dominance of man over a person through the “will to be power” (Wille Zur Macht) is dominance only over himself likely, and not on power, dependence on which everyone feels in himself and to which the creature that has the mind should rule. It is not the will to power by individuals, aimed at subordinating to itself, but the will of mankind, united in the minds of the common cause and its necessity, will achieve the power of knowledge and the aggregate labor of power over nature for the rational and moral management of it. This will be the transition “on the other side of good and evil” in the true sense. The 153rd Aphorism of Nietzsche: “What grows out of love happens on the other side of the knowledge of good and evil”-close to the truth, for only good comes from love (of course, universal!), That is, life without evil, that is, without death. However, this good is not by itself out of love “grows” or “born”, but is created and duned by conscious labor and will, inspired by love.
