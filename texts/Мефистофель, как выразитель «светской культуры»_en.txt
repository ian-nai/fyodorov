If there was no error on the part of the people in the regret, in secularization to see a renunciation of God, then there is no mistake and make a mephistophel from a secular person. What secular people saw only liberation from superstitions, in that for the people there was already renunciation of faith. The whole philosophy of the 18th century was only a liberation from the "superstitions", and France in this sense was the liberator of Germany; And therefore, if Faust is German, then Mephistopheles is a Frenchman, although born in England (as you know, taught France to “free thought”). He was, however, already in the ancient world, but he was called there a “demon” in the good sense of the word. Of course, it is not enough to say that Mephistopheles is a secular person; This secular man is “mondain” from the “higher” spheres, the court, and even the French court, which served as a model for all others. In this area, secularization reaches the highest degree of development; She is not afraid of the devil, nor the devil, that is, she is not afraid of the otherworldly, as well as the alien conscience. That is why Mephistopheles is possible here. If we imagine that in this area, reasons for the struggle reach the highest degree of tension, while morality is on the level of superstition, it is easy to understand what kind of soullessness and heartlessness people can achieve under conditions that are so favorable for the development of these negative qualities. If a person created by this environment is built in her philosopher, his philosophy (with sequence and sincerity on his part) will be a denial of good, recognition of evil. And can it be otherwise in that area of ​​human relations where pretense, secrecy, cunning and bicusinity constitute elementary and at the same time the necessary conditions for the struggle for existence?
