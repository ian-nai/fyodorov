What is the difference between Russian-world history and world-Russian history? The first is only the path by which the second is achieved. Russian-world history points to the sacrifices that Russia made to unite the world. Defending the West from the nomadic East, Russia itself had to defend itself from the West, which, taking advantage of the invasions of the East, even provoked its attacks on us, hoping thereby to enslave its defender. World-Russian history is such a union in which there is neither subordination nor domination. It is to such a union of peoples that the Circular of August 12, 1898 calls.

The program of Russian-world and world-Russian history does not separate secular history from sacred history and popular history from popular history. History will lose its educational value if we separate national history from world history, if we separate history as a fact from history as a project, and if we deprive secular history of its sacred significance and leave unsolved the question of the relationship of rational beings to the irrational force of nature.

When examining and studying the destinies of the human race, we must not limit ourselves to what has been; we must also understand what should be; we must not separate history as a fact from history as a project. By allowing ourselves such a separation, we inspire admiration for success, reverence for good fortune, for what has happened, no matter how immoral it may be; we grovel before a bare fact, no matter what it is. But the deification of a fact alone is blasphemy against the dignity of man and a profanation of history.

By depriving time and place, days and years, localities and countries, persons and events of sacred significance, we deprive them of their moral and aesthetic power and influence. This is the suicide of historical consciousness! Who gave us the right to it in relation to the Past?

Of course, for our “secularized” century, for our civilized “enlightenment” (“civilization”), all days are already equal; all have become routine, everything has smoothed out and faded into colorless mediocrity: there are no dark days of loss and sorrow, no more drama of fasting and repentance; there are no bright days of hope and jubilant joy; no passionate days of common sorrow, no days of common pure rapture, Easter, Sunday!.. But do we not need all this? The soul does not reconcile itself to the emptiness of secularization. As long as love is alive and conscience is glimmering, we need all this; we need both the calendar of saints and the synodics: we must honor the holiness and triumph of what is worthy of praise and imitation; we must mourn our losses, worthy of our love. Our year, opening with the day dedicated to the Gospel child, places at the very beginning of the new summer the beginning of morality, childhood purity and holiness. The entire annual church cycle is the fulfillment and development of this beginning. Here is the true "elementary school" of morality; and what are the textbooks of "civic morality" of the godless schools of purely civil and political community life compared to it! By adding a church to a school, we give the school religious power, and by connecting the school with an art and scientific museum, we impart to the school intellectual persuasiveness and aesthetic inspiration.

In order to become what we should be as rational, free and moral beings, we must recognize the imperfection of what we were and still remain. This means: history as a project must illuminate history as a fact before our understanding. A school inspired by such an understanding of history will teach the consciousness that the human race, from a natural-historical point of view, is initially an insignificant quantity in space and time and among animal organisms; but it will also teach that the smaller a person is by birth, the greater, the higher and more powerful he is in deed, in work.
