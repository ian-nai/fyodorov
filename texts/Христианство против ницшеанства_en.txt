Active Christianity is a reaction against two philosophers of darkness: Nietzsche (with whom his predecessor Max Stirner, now resurrected from the darkness of oblivion, merges) and L. Tolstoy. <<1>>

Nietzsche's philosophy already demands, as a reaction against itself, an active Christianity, a unification for resurrection in place of "going with a tragic understanding (of what is happening) to meet the coming destruction." Nietzsche, a philosopher or, in his words, a tempter, uses all his efforts to make the apocalypse, that is, the terrible news of world destruction, charming, captivating, to turn the terrible into something majestic and to give destruction itself something enticing in its artistic representation.

The origin of tragedy from the Bacchic principle, from intoxication, under the influence of which reality takes on temptingly deceptive images, can be recognized as the path leading to a fall, the path where, behind the infatuation with beauty, oblivion of parents is born and grows.

On the contrary, sobering up,<<2>> understood ethically and aesthetically, comes from the return from the intoxicating phantoms of false beauty to the sober memory of the fathers and to true love for them. This turn does not come from the Bacchic principle (intoxicating and soporific), but from pure and beneficial enthusiasm, from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and the Son as the Image (icon) of the Father, appearing in place of the pagan-Apollonian principle, and in Whom the Spirit and the Son abide in the deepest and purest love.

The first rise, caused by the death of the fathers (the vertical position of man), is a tragic position. This is the moral and artistic (ethical and aesthetic) interpretation of the creation of man by God through the sons of men themselves, or, more accurately, the recreation of a temple to the God of the fathers as a model of all temples. The article "On the vertical position" as the beginning of religion points to the cult of ancestors as a means of salvation from culture, this product of prodigal sons, eternal bridegrooms and brides, with the cult of women, leading to degeneration and extinction. The article "On Easter, on the Easter of Suffering (Crossing) and on the Easter of Resurrection" can be called a story "about the origin of tragedy", ending not in destruction, but in the salvation of the world through universal resurrection.

The article "On Easter" identifies culture in the sense of the cult of ancestors with art, with the unity of artistic style in all manifestations of the life of the human race.

The vertical position and unification in a common chorus of the rebellious sons, performing the cult of ancestors, sons forming, as it were, a single living temple to the Triune God of the fathers - is this not the first work of art [combining in itself not only the height of beauty, but also the depth] of morality, [but] also [the fullness] of knowledge?..

On the contrary, the tragedy (of world destruction) begins with the disunion or destruction of a single temple, the alienation of sons carried away by the cult of woman and creating a culture where industrialism works for her, and militarism defends the industrial kingdom dedicated to woman. The unbridledness (of feelings) and the licentiousness (of will), expressed in the rebellion of sons against fathers, is followed by a general rebellion of the younger against the older, of students against teachers, of citizens against the authorities: after [moral] decline comes [social] disintegration. Such instability creates that perverted order (or rather, disorder), in which the elders (seniors) and those vested with power tremble before the minors, the illegitimate. When all this exists, death is "at the door"! But no matter how sad this situation is, in it, however, tragedy already turns into tragicomedy... It will be a blessing if against such an internally decaying kingdom there are strong-spirited doctors who, like eagles gathering around corpses, uniting themselves, will call forth a broad unification in a general militia of all who have not yet had time to become dead, and will strengthen them in a morally strict military organization...

Nietzscheanism, passively inhuman, we repeat, demands active Christianity as a world healer and leads, albeit against one's will, from fruitless thinking to a saving deed, to a feat of love and knowledge. Nietzsche can (therefore) be considered the last philosopher, if philosophy itself is to be (in its past and present state) considered an attribute and a sign of the immaturity of the human race. The same demon that appears on the threshold of entering the temple of ancient philosophy and teaches its father (Socrates) to "know himself", that is, to know only himself, is also the one who inspires the last philosopher, Nietzsche, by whose admission this demon pointed him to the works of Schopenhauer. In this source of deadening pessimism Nietzsche quenched his spiritual thirst and rose to an independent philosophical (that is, ghostly) existence as a superman. It is not surprising that for one who has plunged into this Lethe, into this river of oblivion of love and pity, that for such a superman everything human has become alien!

But is it not for this reason that Nietzsche himself became the embodiment of mental emptiness and moral sterility? In his insatiable thirst for philosophical originality, he creates nothing but vulgar negations; thirsty for power, he does not know over what or over whom to exercise it; in love with force, he does not understand what to use it for; carried away, finally, by cruelty, he is lost in fantasies about how to provoke it to a superhuman feat.

But while the German "Black Prophet" does not know what to do with his imaginary titanic forces, his Russian brother in negative wisdom, Tolstoy, simply refuses to use force and instead of the Christian testament of positive action (good deeds) preaches only the wisdom of non-action.

He wants to limit Christianity itself to the Sermon on the Mount alone, and even that is incorrectly understood, distorted by him into a set of only negative, Old Testament prescriptions.

From both prophets, preaching two fatal vices - merciless force, turning into cruelty, and impotent indifference (non-action, non-resistance), turning into indulgence in evil - there is no other salvation except Christianity, which turns dogma, confession, confession into a moral matter, into a commandment, but not negative, but positive, but not passive, but active, but not merciless, but full of love, saving from destruction, life-giving love. Such Christianity could become the completion of all Western philosophy; such Christianity would be the atonement of the sins of their parents by sons and daughters and the salvation of all. 1 In Tolstoy we have our own philosopher of darkness, our own prophet, a preacher of non-thinking and non-doing, of movement into the Unknown (which means: "walk in the darkness while it is dark!"), a decadent symbolist who does not recognize the real resurrection and is content with only the symbolic, a hypocrite who stirs up unrest under the guise of non-resistance to evil...

2 By sobering up we must understand not what Nietzsche understood when he identified being with representation or knowledge, without [however] considering this representation as truth. The transition from [one] representation to others gave [him] a series of errors. In this denial of truth, Nietzsche saw enlightenment, peace and freedom, but, at the same time, the absence of purpose and meaning (in life).
