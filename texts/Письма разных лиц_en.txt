<…> I heard that Cherngubov had written an article about N.F. Fyodorov6 for "Vesy". You know how close I was to the deceased, you know that I know the story of how Chernogubov and N. F. met and the former's mental and moral life. I am afraid that in such a mirror the old man's majestic face will not only be distorted, but downright disfigured beyond recognition.

You are right to have your material at your disposal, and I am far from the thought of inconveniencing you in this regard, but I would very much like to look over the article before it is put into general use. This is also necessary because on January 13th there will be a meeting of the deceased's admirers about what to do with his manuscripts that are at our disposal. The material is large and varied.

Would you consider it possible to provide me with the galleys of the article for a while?

If there is no article, then after the 1st No. Libra, if the department turns out to be suitable, I would not mind writing a memoir about the great old man myself. <…>

<…> Here is Peterson’s letter, which he wrote about your note to Dostoevsky’s letter8. I think it can be published. He wants to write memoirs about Nikolai Feodorovich, I answered him that you honor him, but the deceased’s main idea is a great scandal for you, as for many others. <…>

<…> I read with pleasure the articles you sent me in the “Eparchial News”10. You probably have them printed already, and when I come to you, I will read them. I am afraid that when it comes to the resurrection of the forefathers by conquering the cosmic forces of nature, the Lord will not agree with this idea, for, in my opinion, this idea contradicts the testament of the Savior, who promised to resurrect the dead on the last day. — However, now is the time for all sorts of re-evaluations of life, and N. F.'s idea will be appreciated at its true worth. <…>

Dear Sir
Vasily Vasilyevich!

I have decided to send you several pages from the work of a certain person, who has already died, unknown during his lifetime, which is being published in Verny under my editorship; although this person, when personally acquainted, made a great impression on such people as Tolstoy, Vlad. Serg. Soloviev. His papers contain a handwritten letter from Soloviev, written under the impression of reading the manuscript of N-lai F-ch, in which he writes that he is ready to acknowledge himself as his, N-lai F-ch's, disciple, and that he, N-lai F-ch, is the first not only to preach Christ, but also to point out how Christianity can be realized in life, in reality. I am sending you the enclosed sheets, because they indicate the most radical way of resolving the women's question, which you are so preoccupied with. The man I am writing about is N.F. Fedorov, who served for a very long time in the Rumyantsev Museum in Moscow, where he was in charge of the catalog. He was known to many scholars (for example, Buslaev), thanks to the extraordinary depth and breadth of his knowledge, as well as his amazing insight: in his position, he had to search the catalogue for books at the request of readers; according to these requests, he could unmistakably identify a person who was seriously studying and the very subject he was studying, and then send such a person books that he did not request, but which illuminated the subject of his studies from a special side, often completely unexpected for the person himself. In this way, the late N-ay F-ch made many acquaintances. If you wished to get to know him, you can do so through Kozhevnikov’s articles, published in the “Russian Archive” from issue 2 for 1904, and continuing in 1905, although not in every issue—there were ten articles in two years; these articles will continue in 1906, I think, from issue 1; at the end of these articles there will also be placed the letter of Soloviev, which I spoke about in this letter.

I consider it necessary to point out to you also the letter of Dostoevsky to me concerning the teaching of N-lai F-ch, placed in No. 3 of the Russian Archive for 1904 (the original of which is now kept in the Rumyantsev Museum), as well as my response to the note to this letter of the editor of the "Russian Archive", placed in No. 6 of the "Russian Archive" for the same year 1904. Dostoevsky's letter was published back in 1897 in No. 80 of the newspaper "Don", published in the city of Voronezh, but with the omission of the place where it speaks of Vl. Serg. Solovyov, whom N-lai F-ch met after Dostoevsky's death and who was still alive in 1897. A clipping from "The Don" with a letter from Dostoevsky and a preface to it by N-lai F-ch himself, although and supposedly coming from me (in the form of a letter to the editor), I decide to send you, with the most humble request to return to me both this clipping and the sheets from the book being printed; the money that you will spend on returning the appendices to this letter, I ask you to collect from me by cash on delivery.

Please accept the assurance of my highest consideration, always ready for your service
N. Peterson.

My address: Verny, Semirechensk region, to member of the Verny District Court Nikolai Pavlovich Peterson.

After I wrote this letter and already sealed it, I read your article about Dostoevsky on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of his death (No. 10730)12 and thought whether I should write to you, whether anything good can come of this, are we not speaking different languages, just as it was during the Tower of Babel? — You say that Christ founded a kingdom outside of blood and tribe, that the most fundamental and most individually characteristic feature of the Church lies in its bloodlessness and incorporeality, — And you say this about Him Who said: “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man (that is, His, Christ’s, flesh) and drink His blood, you have no life in you” (John 4:53 et seq.); You say this about Christianity, the greatest mystery of which is the mystery of body and blood. And the mystery of body and blood is the restoration of kinship, which, being relatives, we have forgotten; but in the words “whoever does not hate his father and mother” only exclusive attachment to one’s own, to one’s own family and tribe, as among the Jews, is condemned, which makes them hate everyone else, so that the consolation of Israel will not be its own bliss alone, but also the terrible torments of all the others, who were all its enemies. There is no opposition between Christianity and paganism, Christianity is the reconciliation of everyone and everything, the reconciliation of all antagonisms, contradictions; paganism (language-people) is a popular religion, and Christianity is a pan-popular, pan-paganism. The Holy Trinity is not a dogma, but a commandment, a commandment about kinship, about the restoration of kinship in the image and likeness of God; man individually cannot be the image and likeness of God, he becomes such only in the aggregate of the whole race, when the whole race is united in the image and likeness of the Holy Trinity, indivisible and unmerged, when even in the human race the personalities that make it up will be inseparable, one while maintaining the complete independence of each personality, without the merging of personalities into an indifferent unity. God is kinship love, this is the Father, Son and Daughter (Holy Spirit); in the image of the Divine Trinity, the human race must also become a multi-unit, or all-unit being; just as there is nothing alien in God, only related, so the human race must become a true race, a kinship of the same essence and blood with all brothers through Christ and with the Triune God himself, and not disintegrate into self-determining individuals who guard their rights, for whom it is only funny when they are told: if you are struck on the cheek, offer the other (and yet this is what Themistocles did, or almost this, when Eurybiades swung at him), if they ask for outer clothing, give them your shirt too (this was mocked in one proclamation published in Verny), etc. In a word, the legal order, civilization, and civic consciousness, which transform people from brothers into strangers to one another, only into fellow citizens, neighbors, comrades, are the direct opposite of Christianity, which is a godlike kinship, a relationship, but only universal, and not an exclusive attachment to one's own, to one's own clan-tribe; this exclusiveness is Judaism and paganism. We are neither Europeans nor Asians, we are between Europe and Asia, and if we want to be Christians, we must reconcile Europe with Asia, [overcome] European discord and forced Asian unification; we must find in ourselves a true unity without fusion and a true independence of individuals without discord. Through us the prayer of Christ must be realized: "That they all may be one: as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us (John XVII, 21), through us the image given to us in the teaching of the Trinity Indivisible and unmerged, at the basis of which lies the above-mentioned prayer of Christ, "That they all may be one," must be realized. This is where our uniqueness lies, we must unite in ourselves everything and everyone, this is Christianity, which is not found in Europe, nor in Asia, and will exist only in the unification of Europe and Asia, Africa, America and Australia, in the elimination of all contradictions; then we will enter into unity with God, for which Christ prayed, then there will be resurrection and immortality. But all this will be through us, through the whole human race, and will not happen by itself, as one might think according to Elpe's article, "Life and Resurrection"13, in feuilleton of "Novogo Vremya" No. 10708, dated January 5. Who is this Elpe? I sent him several articles, but have not received any answer.

Dear and dear brother and friend Nikolai Pavlovich!

Three days ago, to my greatest pleasure, I finally received the book of the unforgettable N-ya F-ch15 and immediately gave it to Seryozha for binding, and today I received it already bound and am starting to read it, after correcting the misprints. I do not know whether everything in this book will be accessible to me, but I will try to read it without haste and ponder what I have read. While reading this book, I will undoubtedly recall the sympathetic personality of the author himself, as if I were hearing his voice, I will recall his conversations in Kerensky, in the library, over a glass of tea, arousing in my soul a cheerful feeling and the consciousness that even the most insignificant person can join a great cause and bring a certain share of benefit. I remember how from the speeches of N-ya F-ch peace settled in my soul and moral anxiety was replaced by spiritual balance, as when reading his works, under the impression of which I felt in myself a desire to become more moral and active than I usually was. And did we, who read at that time what he wrote, often even in pencil, on separate scraps of paper, think that the time would come when a whole book would be compiled from these sheets of paper, which would introduce the world to the great common cause, the cause of universal salvation, hitherto unknown to the world, which would now finally become known and, perhaps, would lead life along a new channel, open the true path and show people the true and only goal. Thank you for sending me this book, and, without attaching any importance to these thoughts of mine, believe that I am sincerely pleased with your, or, better to say, N-ya F-cha, this precious gift. I will read and try to think about it as much as I can, in order to understand and, if possible, assimilate what I have read. V. A. KOZHEVNIKOV — F. D. SAMARIN16

<…> Heartfelt thanks also for the appeal addressed to me to assist the cause! But here again I am forced to contradict your exaggerated good opinion of my suitability for work in the "Circle"17. For any systematic course I frankly admit my inadequacy; however, I do not refuse individual lectures on some topics and I am making an effort to prepare something in this sense. Until now I have been distracted by rather persistent work on finishing my book on the teachings of Nikolai Fedorovich Fedorov: in order to strengthen his thoughts on an active worldview and on the management of nature, it was necessary to make excursions into the area of ​​the latest natural-historical and even mathematical theories, and this responsible work required considerable effort of thought and some preparation in the relevant literature. Now, having, with God's help, emerged from these natural-philosophical thickets and having set forth in writing the results of my searches and thoughts, I can turn to the topics planned for the readings in the "Circle".

Dear Nikolai Pavlovich,

If I am not mistaken, it was you who sent me a brochure for my 55th birthday19. This brochure gave me only pleasure, namely, the memory of you and dear unforgettable Nikolai Fyodorovich. I was only very sorry to see that you treat me with ill-will, while I have nothing but the most tender, kind feelings for you, not to mention the memory of the unforgettable, most remarkable person Nikolai Fyodorovich. If I am not mistaken, please write to me directly; communication with you will be very dear to me.

I am very sorry that I cannot agree with what you write, so strictly analyzing my very unimportant, weak legends20. I cannot agree because now, standing on the threshold of physical death, I am more and more convinced of the benefit of physical death and the impossibility of the death of the spirit by which I live, if I live by it, that is, by love. “And we know that we have passed from death to life if we love the brothers. He who does not love his brother does not have eternal life abiding in him. But he who loves his brother has eternal life abiding in him”21. I not only believe in this, but with my whole being I experience the truth of it.
Loving you, Leo Tolstoy.

My deeply respected and infinitely dear Lev Nikolaevich!

Your letter astonished me, your moral height is amazing, and I can only bow before you. But your expression that I treat you "with ill will" is inaccurate and incorrect; it is not you we treat with ill will, and even more than that, but the obstacle that prevents us from coming together in one common cause for the good of all. And with what love would those wonderful eyes light up, which you found evil - according to your words in 189923 - when they turned to you - with what love for you those eyes would light up, if you were to render even the slightest assistance to the call for a common cause for all people, which is contained in the book sent to you together with this, entitled "The Philosophy of the Common Cause." After your letter to me, I am not afraid to send you this book, although you will find much evil in it about yourself, but I have no doubt that you will also find in it much that will make you, with your amazing moral height, forgive this evil to a man who valued above all else the feat of Moses, who wanted to suffer with the people of God rather than rejoice with the Egyptians, the feat of Themistocles, who, at the council before the Battle of Salamis, said to Eurybiades, who had raised his hand against him: "Strike, but only listen." N-lai F-ch always put forward this feat of Themistocles as an explanation of Christ's instruction to turn the other cheek when you are struck on one. N-lai F-ch used to say that those who participate in one common cause, to which they are devoted with all their being, cannot be offended by one another, and if something similar were to happen among co-workers in such a cause, then there will always be someone ready to sacrifice his own personality rather than the common cause. N-lai F-ch blamed you for the teaching that everyone can be saved alone, alone, without needing the company of others for this, everyone can create the Kingdom of God within himself. But the opinion of N-lai F-ch, expressed, among other things, on page 159 of the book being sent and in the preceding ones, “to allow salvation in isolation, separately” means to deny kinship, brotherhood and fatherland, the commandment of love. There is a large article dedicated to you24, not yet published, in which all the reproaches made to you are concentrated, in which N-lai F-ch blames himself for being forced to make these reproaches to you, and at the same time turns to you with a request to assist in the call for a common cause for all - a call to which N-lai F-ch devoted his entire long life, but died without finding, in his opinion, a worthy expression for this call. On his instructions, I submitted this article to the Censorship Committee in 1896, but the censors, who disagreed with you, found the teaching set forth in the article much worse than yours, and therefore banned the article25.

I also allow myself to ask your assistance in making known to as many people as possible the call to a common cause for all people, which is contained in the book I am sending you. Your assistance in this can be expressed by sending for publication in some suitable periodical my article20, inserted in the middle of the book, at the head of which stands the title of the book by N-lai F-ch. And if you could find it possible to say a few words about the author of this book, if not about the book itself, then you would force many, very many people to read the book, and perhaps a person will be found who will enter into the idea of ​​N-lai F-ch and will be able to express it in such a way that it will become jОCHa and understandable to everyone. The book itself should be difficult to read, there is much inconsistency in it, for which one should blame not the author, but the publishers, their ineptitude, as well as the impossibility, due to concerns about existence, of devoting themselves entirely to the great cause. However, individual places in this book are amazing. Read, for example, paragraph 13 on page 93, starting with the words in the last line: "The question of why good people suffer," or on page 192 (at the end), starting with the words: "Everything accomplished by the encyclopedists," etc., ending on page 198; on page 76, starting with the words: "In the confession of the Symbol of Faith," you need to read several pages. However, you cannot list everything.

Help me, Lev Nikolaevich, to make this book known and thereby turn the unfriendliness you noticed in my brochure into the most ardent devotion, thereby you will make the day I received your letter, February 25, 1908, the happiest day of my life.

Of course, I do not need any fee for the article and I do not need to put my name under the article. — I must tell you that I sent this same article back in October to Metropolitan Anthony with a request to publish it in one of the spiritual journals, indicating what in it disagrees with the point of view of our official representatives of the church; but I have not received any response from the Metropolitan. I would only like to be sent the issue of the journal or newspaper where my article will be published, and, if possible, several copies of the article. 27

I most humbly ask you to convey my deepest respect and express my deep respect to Sofya Andreyevna.

With all my soul, devoted to you
N. Peterson.

Truly He is Risen!

Much respected, dear Nikolai Pavlovich!

Bringing you my congratulations on today's Highly Newborn/9, I inform you that I received your letter of April 18 and 5 copies of your brochure "The Truth about the Great Writer, etc." with great pleasure and offer you my sincere gratitude. I am happy that you remember me. Indeed, I personally handed over a copy of "The Philosophy of the Common Cause" first to Vasil. Vasil. Rozanov, then to the editors of "New Time" and then to Mikh. Osip. Menshikov30. I must inform you that I am not only “not indifferent” to the book of the Great and unforgettable Nikolai Feodorovich, but that I consider it a special mercy of God to me that I met Nikolai Feodorovich in my life, was acquainted with him and personally became acquainted with his only correct and acceptable to me in its entirety teaching and interpretation of the teaching of Christ. Only this interpretation I consider to be truly Orthodox. And I place his book in the category of Sacred Books, completing the series of the Rigveda, Zend-Avesta, Bible, Kvangelie, Koran, already received by mankind. And therefore I already wrote to Vladimir Alexandrovich81 when the "Philosophy of the Common Cause" appeared, that I welcome your and his high impulse to disseminate this book and, of course, the only correct and completely worthy of it, as a Revelation sent by God to people through Nikolai Feodorovich, I consider its first appearance in the world in the form in which you conceived and executed "Not for sale". I believe that the soul of the Great Teacher is pleased with both of you.

After I, after meeting with Nikolai Feodor, recognized myself as his disciple, I, of course, could not remain indifferent to everything that concerned Him and His teaching, I tried to become more deeply acquainted with His teaching myself and to acquaint other people who seemed to me interested not only in base interests, with this teaching. I cannot boast of success, but still I have acquired two followers - one gendarme officer and one naval engineer-mechanic. I decided to take and present a copy of "The Philosophy of the Common Cause" to Rozanov, because it seemed and seems to me that he belongs to the number of "those who seek the truth" and I feel sorry for him, and to Menshikov because if he were interested in this book, then, as the most brilliant feuilletonist of our time, he could interest many people in it. That he writes nonsense all the time is not surprising, for he "drives money" into his own pocket, but sometimes he seems to me, just like Rozanov, to be wandering and passing so close to the truth with blind eyes that I feel offended for him and want to say to him: look, there is the light! But it seems I was mistaken. It is unlikely that any good will come of this, and probably neither of them will even look at the book given to them.

Rozanov is proud that he himself gives birth to thoughts and, like a spider, weaves his own web and is even afraid, apparently, of other people's thoughts, so as not to lose his originality. And Menshikov told me directly: "What am I going to do with this book?!" - "Whatever you want!" - "But I can't read it... unless they put me in the Peter and Paul Fortress?!.. And who is this Nick. Fed. Fedorov?" - and to my brief explanation: "Isn't this the thinker that Count Lev Nikolaevich told me about? That he highly respected him?" - "Yes, that very one." - "That's interesting! But still, what should I do with it?" Then I said to him: "If the late thinker had possessed the gift of exposition that you possess, then his ideas, without a doubt, would soon have conquered the whole world." He smiled wryly and said: "Well, thank you, I'll study, I'll study!" - and we parted.

"Novoe Vremya" and the "Novovremenites", who fuss over the so-called great writer of the Russian land (or, in my opinion, more correctly, the great novelist), like a hen with an egg, of course, have not yet said a single line about the "philosopher of the common cause", despite the fact that I delivered a copy to them back in early February. <…>

Dear
Lev Nikolaevich!

I received a letter from P. A. Sergeenko, in which he invites me to take part in a collection for the almanac bearing your name, published for your 80th birthday33. I will take part in this collection with the greatest pleasure and hope to soon send Mr. Sergeenko what I am thinking of putting into this collection; but I would like Nikolai Fyodorovich to take part in this collection as well. In my letter in response to yours I already informed you of the article by N-lai F-ch34, where he clearly exposed what he saw as incorrect in you, but at the same time he acknowledges your genius, acknowledges you as gifted with all ten talents and turns to you, one might say, with a plea - to help the cause that should unite the Russian people not only internally, with itself, but also with all nations; recognizes your power and asks you to help the cause in which alone lies salvation, salvation not of someone, but universal salvation, of everyone, not allowing any exceptions. (The article is quite long, translation into other languages ​​will be difficult, and therefore it should be published only in Russian). Would you agree to this article being placed in a collection under the almanac bearing your name? The placement of this article in the collection and at your insistence (otherwise it will not be published) would be a truly great act worthy of you. This would testify that you do not want only praise and are not afraid of condemnation. The article I am writing about is in the hands of V.A. Kozhevnikov, whose permanent address is placed at the end of my preface to the book "Philosophy of the Common Cause", and now, since May, his address is: Yalta, Isar, his own dacha, to Vladimir Alexandrovich Kozhevnikov. Vladimir Alexandrovich is such an admirer of you that he will immediately deliver the article to you, as soon as you wish to have it. If for some reason you find it inconvenient to contact V.A. Kozhevnikov directly, telegraph me thus: "Faithful Peterson, send the article", and I will immediately contact Kozhevnikov by telegraph and he, I have no doubt, will deliver the article to you.

Along with this I am sending you a reprint of my article from the Diocesan Gazette about the letter of Gr. Petrov to Metropolitan Anthony35. I humbly ask you to inform me whether you have sent my article anywhere, which was enclosed in the copy of the book “Philosophy of the Common Cause”36 sent to you; if it cannot be printed, please do not refuse to return it. I humbly ask you to express my deep respect to Sofya Andreyevna. With all my soul, devoted to you and deeply respecting you.

Dear and sweet Nikolai Pavlovich,

I begin writing to you with fear. I am terribly guilty before you. Your article, which was included in Nikolai Fyodorovich's book, has disappeared somewhere. Whether I sent it somewhere (although this is doubtful), or, what is most likely, it is in our books and papers, the fact is that I cannot find it. That is why I was so slow in answering your letter. We have been looking for the article and are still looking. Please write, do you have a copy?

I will be very glad to publish Nikolai Fyodorovich's article about me, and I am now writing to Kozhevnikov, asking him to send it to Sergeyenka38. You are a little unkind to me, assuming that I do not want to see Nikolai Fyodorovich's article in print only because he condemns me. Its publication will depend on the publisher. I have expressed my desire.
Yours lovingly, Leo Tolstoy.

Fedorov’s book, in its basic views, was known to Lev N-ch even earlier; but, as you know, the idea of ​​resurrection does not meet with his sympathy, and he is quite satisfied with the teaching that our body cannot be immortal, and the spirit cannot be mortal. In this sense, he understands the teachings of the greatest sages of the world. With respect, at your service, N. Gusev.

Dear
Valery Yakovlevich!

I am happy to fulfill your expressed wish to receive Nikolai Fyodorovich's book and mine: tomorrow I will send them to you by registered parcel. I would have sent them even without your letter; I did not deliver N. F-ch's book earlier because I wanted to add my articles to it, although very disheveled and unfinished, but containing materials that were not included in Volume I of "The Philosophy of the Common Cause".

Knowing (and appreciating) the breadth of your talent, I have never doubted the "sincerity and seriousness" of your interest in the thoughts of N. F-ch. For the same reasons, I allow myself to hope that you will not impute to Nikolai F-ch and the exponent of his thoughts, who merged as closely as possible with him in the exposition, some kind of reproach to the new direction of art for what, from the very definite point of view of N. F-ch on the task of art, seemed an undesirable absolute arbitrariness of artistic talent.

I would be very much obliged to you and glad if you would say in "Vesa" your always original word about the book of Nikolai F-ch and, perhaps, mine too, if you see in it, according to the materials, some addition to the first.
Yours sincerely, V. Kozhevnikov.

Dear Sir,
respected
Nikolai Pavlovich!

I am writing to you in accordance with the instructions and recommendation of Klavdy Efimovich Gorokhovsky[1]. He informed me that your book “Philosophy of the Common Cause” can only be obtained from you personally, since it is not for sale, and he interested me in it, informing me that, in his opinion, the main idea of ​​the book is the superiority of collective reason over individual reason.

This idea seems to me absolutely correct. That which is impersonal is absolutely correct. Of all the definitions of the Deity, the most appealing to me is: “without faces.” "We" are wiser than "I": the family is wiser than the individual, society is wiser than the family, humanity is wiser than society, nature is wiser than humanity, and the Deity is wiser than all that exists. "The common cause" is more powerful than the personal. If I am not mistaken, the philosopher Hartmann has the idea that if all of humanity simultaneously wanted non-existence, then "the sky would roll up like a scroll," in the words of the Apocalypse, and the world would disappear. This idea is paradoxical, for it is too anthropocentric; if the world is "representation and will" (according to Schopenhauer), then to change the world it is necessary to change the "representation and will" of all that exists, and not just humanity alone. Nevertheless, the idea of ​​the power of the "common" cause greatly interests me, and the boldness of the conclusions drawn from it does not stop me. The idea expressed by K. E. Gorokhovsky that among the conclusions of your philosophy there is a hypothesis about the possibility of resurrection of the dead attracts me to your work more than it repels me from it.

My request: send me this book to the address printed in the title of this letter.

Please accept the assurance of my highest consideration.
Vsev. Cheshikhin.

I was glad to receive your letter, the interest in the book I published cannot but please me, since this book is not only a thought, not an idea, but a call to action, - I was also pleased to learn that K. E. Gorokhovsky did not forget such an Asian backwater as our Verny, even in Riga, a completely European city. But I must say, the idea of ​​the book I published is not at all as Klavdy Efimovich reported, in any case, there is much more in it than K<lavdy> E<fimovich> saw. Individual reason is just as important as collective; indeed, there would be no collective reason if there were no individual; without individual reason, there would be indifference, an indifferent unity, i.e., there would be nothing. The whole history of the human race is a struggle between Eastern unity, a unity achieved by violence, coercion, before which everything individual is erased, destroyed, with Western individualism, which leads to discord, strife and struggle. And yet man cannot renounce either individual freedom, provided that it does not lead to discord, strife and struggle, or the desire for the unity of all individuals, but for a unity achieved not by violence; it is required that the freedom of the individual not be the freedom to fulfill his whims, which leads to discord, strife and struggle, and that unity not be forced, so that it is not violence, leading everyone to the Procrustean bed, so that the equality to which such unity leads does not exist [further not preserved].

<…> Yes, what will be the fate of the 2nd volume now? You say that you and Kozhevnikov can part ways: stop corresponding. I wonder if he wrote you anything. From all my conversations with Kozhevnikov, I have concluded that he views N. F.'s teaching almost exclusively as philosophy, completely forgetting that it is, first of all, a common cause. It also seems to him that N. F. has left too little room for grace, and he is waiting for a philosopher who would give it its due. <…>

<…> From a comparison of what is in F. O. D. about language with the opinions of other authors, I, one might say, did not draw any conclusions, I only hinted at conclusions, but I got the impression that the creation of a common language is not a chimera, although modern linguistics does not set this as a goal. The fundamental difference between N. F. and other authors is that they are engaged in their science out of curiosity, while N. F. looks at it as a necessary means for the implementation of a common cause. Hence the different views on the task: there - how language appeared, here - the creation of a common language40.

<…> It would be very interesting to get acquainted with your correspondence with Vl. Al. Kozhevnikov. How interesting that you both began to quarrel. My analogy with Nik is more complete. Fyodor, with Christ. You, of course, Peter, ardent, zealous and pure in heart. Vl. Al. — Paul, the apostle of the pagans, like Vladimir — the enlightener of the Russian pagans, Paul — the scribe and Pharisee. They also quarreled and denounced each other. May both Christ and Nik. Fyodor forgive me for this analogy, if it needs forgiveness. However, Paul said: "Blessed is he who does not condemn himself in what he chooses."47 I do not condemn myself. <…>

Dear Nikolai Pavlovich!

From your letter of August 27, I see that you were upset by my printed note about the book by N. F. Fedorov48. I am very sorry. The book is, on the whole, remarkable, and I am very grateful to you for sending it. I gave a lecture on it to my circle of acquaintances this summer and would not mind devoting a public lecture to it. In essence, you have nothing to be upset about: you sent N. F. Fedorov's book to a man who is sincerely interested in the "common cause" of resurrecting the dead and who treats this matter with thoughtful seriousness. This is enough for the most ardent admirer of N. F. Fedorov; and the fact that you and I do not agree on details (especially on the question of whether ambition can be the source of truly noble deeds) is, of course, unimportant.

Here are some new aphorisms from my notebook, prompted by reflections on the “common cause” (as you can see, N. F. Fedorov’s spiritual seed is sprouting):

“Resurrection of the dead… Flammarion assures us that worlds are repeated in the universe, and even an innumerable number of times. Why should man combine atoms himself? Nature is already combining them! In order to meet an ancestor, it is enough to find a double of the earthly planet at one or another moment of its existence, past or future. So, the task of resurrecting the dead is simpler than Fedorov thinks. It consists in a complete victory over space and in the possibility of moving ad libitum49 to any corner of the universe.
***

The connection between the resurrection of the dead and brotherhood. Why does man live? — for the brotherhood of resurrecting the dead. Why does man die? — because he does not know brotherhood and does not know how to resurrect the dead. Death is a lack of love; life is love. What a wonderful connection! How beautiful the world is in its fundamental principles!
***

Time travel (moving for a time to past and future)... How to realize it?.. I think so. We must learn to combine atoms in the same way as they were combined by us, say, ten years ago. If we combine these atoms in this way, then we disappear from the eyes of those around us and live in the past (repeating what we once lived) for as long as the given combination of atoms lasts. If a person learns to foresee the future and find the atomic formulas of his descendants, then he will be able to transport himself into the future by similar methods.

Whoever conquers matter will conquer both time and space... However, why conquer matter and time? It is enough to conquer space - Mother Nature herself will do the rest for us - for, in view of the multiplicity of worlds, it is always possible to find in the universe the desired combination of atoms at the desired moment in time. The task of resurrecting ancestors is the task of establishing communication with the most remote corners of stellar spaces. ***

The task of communicating with the stars is the task of resurrecting ancestors (see previous aphorisms). How to approach it? - In my opinion, with experiments on light, - for rays of light are a bridge between the earth and the celestial spaces. Oh, if only light turned out to be matter (Newton's theory) and a conductor of electricity! After all, then it would be possible to send a telegram to Mars and receive a reply from there (I believe in the habitability of Mars)! - this would be the beginning of N.F. Fedorov's "common cause"! ***

Until there is brotherhood on earth, earthly humanity will not go beyond the limits of its planet, i.e. will not learn to resurrect the dead, and it is clear why: the current Karsh humanity, having penetrated this secret, would establish its Cain-like order in the heavenly spaces and would corrupt worlds better than our lousy helicopter (an idea beautifully developed by Dostoevsky in the story "The Dream of a Ridiculous Man")... The secret of time and term - and may it be blessed!

By the way: about the fact that Solovyov visited Fedorov, one Muscovite told me about 10 years ago. They probably knew each other personally.

With respect: Vsev. Cheshikhin.

I am writing to you with a most humble request, if it is not too much trouble, to send me N. F. Fedorov's book "Philosophy of the Common Cause" under a parcel post, cash on delivery.

If this book is not particularly expensive, please send me two copies. I could not get it anywhere here. I contacted L. N. Tolstoy and P. A. Sergienko, who pointed you out.
Yours sincerely, A. Ginken.

<…> The one who has upset me unspeakably is Vl. Al. Kozhevnikov. I was wrong to call him Pavel! He is simply Judas Iscariot! He was with me and, of course, I pestered him with questions. When will the second volume come out? and why does he keep getting distracted and falling into temptation, either by Buddha or by monasticism, which descends from him in a direct line? And he told me such things, that it is very difficult, that Novoselov and Samarin find that the teaching of Nikolai Fyodor is not in agreement with Orthodoxy, that he, V. A. Kozhevnikov, must atone for his guilt before Orthodoxy, that Bulgakov, whose son51 died, after he read the “Philosophy of the Common Cause”, fell into despair and told him, Vl. Al-chu, that the teaching of Nikolai Fyodor contradicts Orthodoxy because the teaching of Nikolai Fyodor says nothing about grace, that he, Vl. Al., wrote to you, asking for clarification, and that you did not explain anything to him about this and did not point out the places where grace was spoken of52. I listened to this nonsense, my eyes just popping out at him! And he said to him: “And you tell me this! And you couldn’t find something to say to that slug Bulgakov? And what about Divine Providence? And the very appearance of Nik. Fyodor, and his interpretation, isn’t that a manifestation of grace?” He was embarrassed, but finished the conversation by saying that he wasn’t thinking of publishing Volume II and wasn’t working on it, being busy with his own works, giving lectures (and other nonsense), that the work on Volume II itself was so difficult, almost impossible, that he wasn’t sure that Nik. Fyodor’s teaching didn’t contradict Orthodoxy. I fell silent, so as not to curse him with abuse, like my guest. But I thought: Poor old Nikolai Fyodorovich! What a Judas Iscariot he had among his closest disciples! What an amazing type! For him, everything and always is only Volume One! And the continuation is gone! “Philosophy of Feeling and Faith”, Volume 1. Nikolai Fyodor. Fyodorov. Volume I. "The Philosophy of the Common Cause". Vol. I and there is no end anywhere! It is clear that he is only amusing himself and the main thing for him is that the whole world knows what kind of man he is, Vlad. Alex. Kozhevnikov, an intelligent and learned man who has sucked out all the bookish wisdom and amazes everyone with endless and countless references to all sorts of works in all the languages ​​of the world. But, in essence, this terrible shell only covers up the absence of a nut inside. There is nothing of his own! He owes everything to the Great One! And he interested himself, having the thoughts of the Great One inside! A compiler, nothing more! And now that he has renounced the Great One, what is left? A shell and nut tobacco! A fistula! And nothing more! His "On the Significance of Christian Asceticism"53 that this oh, such as not chewing some kind of camel cud from the fourth stomach - again in the mouth and again chewing with a thoughtful look! I wrote to him briefly on a postcard! Humanity has long ago gone through the experiences of monasticism. To call for it again, having the Great Teaching, is a pity, especially for the one who once wrote: "A life of deprivation, the life of an ascetic, idle battles with oneself" 54 and so on. He did not answer me. And what can he tell me? He knows very well that I have known him for 40 years, for I am 45, and that during this time I have figured him out so much that, as Chichikov's teacher, I can repeat: I know him through and through, as he does not know himself! For him, Nikolai Fyodor was only a step towards his own exaltation. Renowned for someone else's wisdom, he ended up in the circle of Samarins and other serf-owners and obscurantists and now amuses himself by giving lectures to some idiots. But I suppose they'll figure him out soon! And of course, when the Great One is dead, it's hard to sit in the Lion's skin! <…>

At present he is busy in Poltava painting the picture “The Tsar at the Poltava Celebrations Talks with Representatives of the People.” He read the brochure and was very interested, but said that now, until he finishes the painting commissioned from him, he cannot paint anything else. He considers the plot proposed in the brochure so difficult that for now, without thinking seriously about it, he cannot imagine whether he is able to cope with it58. <…> Vladimir Alexandrovich visited me in Petersburg on Holy Week. We spoke again about the "philosophy of the common cause," and he was the first to tell me that as soon as he finished his work on Buddhism, he was thinking of working on the second volume.

Dear
Lev Nikolaevich!

Once again I have decided to send you my article "Can the Unity of People Be the Goal of Human Life," written in connection with your letter to the Slavic Congress in Sofia and Menshikov's response to this letter60. I would like you to see how happy I am when I can agree with you on something, and how hard it is for me, how painful and hurtful it is for me—hurtful for you yourselves—when I am forced to write what you ask me not to write to you. In any case, there are few around you who love you as sincerely as I love you. Along with the article about your letter, I am sending (by registered parcel post) two of my articles about Rodionov’s book “Our Crime”61, so celebrated by Menshikov… I would be very glad if you would read these articles as well. I humbly ask you to express my deep respect to Sofya Andreyevna and all of yours. We have a stepson of your eldest daughter Tatyana Lvovna in Verny, but I have never seen him, because I do not go to so-called society, clubs or performances (we have no theaters). Sincerely devoted to you

I received your letter, dear Nikolai Pavlovich, and recognized you in it and everything that I love in you and that is truly worthy of love from everyone. I read your articles and agreed with many of them, but as always, unfortunately, I cannot agree with your main idea (about salvation, salvation in the sense that you understand it) — neither with you, nor with the dear memory of Nikolai Fyodorovich. You find that my idea that deliverance, liberation from evil is that religious foundation of life which unites and can unite people, is unfair, that this foundation is insufficient. This foundation is nothing other than love, that same feeling which is inherent in all people, as each one is aware of in himself and as we see most clearly in children.

Love is God, God is love, as the Apostle John63 expresses this and as we all—at least I—are fully aware. And therefore, from my point of view, all our activity, especially the efforts of non-action, should be directed toward the unification of all, which constitutes the essence and goal of love. This goal is achieved by a very specific activity, the activity of abstaining from and correcting oneself from all those sins, temptations and superstitions—fornication, greed, ill will, pride, vanity, vindictiveness, false church [and] scientific teachings—that hinder the achievement of the goal of love—unity.

That is all I wanted to tell you. I do not remember when and about what I asked you not to write to me64. I even I am very ashamed if I have ever asked you about this. Please write to me about everything that is close to your heart, and especially about things in which you disagree with me and criticize me. This is always useful, especially from such sincere people, kare ve, and therefore pleasant. I do not have Nikolai Fyodorovich's book, and therefore, please send it to me. I will certainly reread it carefully.

Farewell!
Sincerely loving you
Leo Tolstoy.

Dear Nikolai Pavlovich!

You have probably completely despaired of receiving a letter from me. I apologize very much for not writing for so long, but I have not had time to "digest" the thoughts that arose in Verny under your influence. And even now I have not finished reading “The Philosophy of the Common Cause” to the end, it is very difficult to read, and there is little free time, but still, during my leisure time, I take it up and read with ever-increasing interest. This book just resolves one of the so-called “damned questions” - about the meaning of life.

I first had to think about this question about a year ago, about the suicide of one comrade. He poisoned himself without any external reasons: he was “lucky” in life, he studied well at the University and suddenly drank potassium cyanide. This suicide had a truly stunning effect on everyone around him, including me. Indeed: why live, subject yourself to all sorts of suffering and worries, if it is so simple and easy to end life. Are these sufferings and worries compensated by happiness? No, for it is transient. Then, to solve all these questions, I invented a theory for myself that my life does not belong to me, but to humanity. I will be satisfied if my life and activity are a component, even an insignificant one, of one of the component forces from which the resultant force is obtained, moving humanity forward.

Forward, but where? What is true progress (forward movement)? I could not resolve these questions, etc., the significance of all my reasoning was reduced to zero. All these questions were resolved, or rather are in the process of being resolved, by the "Phil<osophy> of the Common Cause".

Humanity must move along the path of unification into a single society, organized not on any oligarchic or anarchic principles, but on the principle of kinship in the image of the Trinity, indivisible, but also unmerged. The common cause of this single family must be the establishment of the dominance of human reason over the blind forces of nature.

So far I can only accept the teaching of N. F. Fedorov. Resurrection is not yet completely clear to me, it is still a utopia for me, and nothing more.

Then I am not a religious person; I have little interest in religion, because I have always looked at it from a metaphysical point of view. So far I have not yet developed a view on the moral side of religion. And according to N. F., as I understand it, religion is rather a moral system (dogma - commandment).

I think that all this and much more will become clear to me as I continue reading "Phil<osophy> of the Common Cause>". I hope that you will allow me to occasionally write to you about these issues in the future. Forgive me for writing without a plan and style: I write as best I can. In the meantime, I would like to say a few words to you about the following: it seems to me that you approve of the modern administrative system and think that the "powers that be" cannot and do not want to harm the common cause and that, on the contrary, the academic class is its enemy. I do not agree with this; I will give you an example: in Odessa there lived prof. A. V. Klassovsky, a meteorologist (you have probably heard of him). By the way, he organized a whole network of rural meteorological stations and laid the foundation for a whole science of "agricultural meteorology". After all, this can serve as the beginning of a common cause! And the mayor Tolmachev, fearing that he would prevent the "truly Russian" Levashov from becoming a rector, sent him out of Odessa, and thus tore him away from his favorite work. And there are many such examples! <…>

<…> Still, I love Tolstoy, I even consider him great: a great writer. It seems that you and I do not agree on this. As far as I understand you, you do not recognize our writers as “great writers of the Russian land” because they only dig in the dirt of our reality, and do not give us a single bright type, do not tell us what to do. It seems to me that the latter goal is most likely satisfied by works like “Phil<osophy> of the Common Cause”, and above all this book itself, and take, for example, “War and Peace”. What a mass of images there are and not all of them are negative!

This, in my opinion, is the study of human nature, which must be directed toward good, this is even a resurrection, mental, of course. After all, this fits the goal of art given by Nik. Fed-chem, if I'm not mistaken. Here's more about resurrection in art: the words of a completely modern man, even, perhaps, a Westerner, the artist Al. Benois. In his review of the production of "Boris Godunov" he writes that the acting in this opera resurrects our ancestors, and not Russians of a certain era, and all Russians in general. I understand resurrection in this sense, the cult of ancestors, and not only do I understand it, but I consider it necessary (I was convinced of this by reading the book by Nikolai Fed-ch), but in the real sense I simply cannot imagine it. I also completely agree with the idea of ​​a debt to the fathers and the payment of this debt by resurrection, but I think that this payment can be made by a victory over death and the cult of ancestors as a symbol of resurrection (history and art also come into play here). I do not understand one place in Nikolai Fed-ch on page 112 of the “Phil<osophy> of the Common Cause>” about resurrection. It says there: “Those who consider the common cause of resurrection fantastic cannot speak of a victory over paganism.” It seems to me that regulation is quite sufficient for this, as it is said there, a few lines above: “Regulation is a true, and not just imaginary, triumph over pagan gods,” etc. <…>

I read an article about bibliography in “Phil<osophy> of the Common Cause”66, and I liked it very much. I especially liked the idea that students should work independently under the guidance of professors. But it seems to me that an encyclopedia is also important. In order to understand the bibliography of a given branch of knowledge, one must be at least superficially encyclopedically familiar with its foundations. Modern pedagogical literature is already largely following this path. For example, Khvolson’s physics course67. One of its main advantages is the rich literary references (arranged in chronological order). It is like a combination of an encyclopedia and a bibliography.

I fully agree with you, highly respected Nikolai Pavlovich, that all disagreements between us will be eliminated. I am simply amazed by the greatness of the fundamental idea of ​​Nik. Fed-ch—the idea of ​​the Common Cause. This is the only thing that can give meaning to life. I have already spoken in this sense in one circle. But I was apparently misunderstood, since I was very excited. I am thinking of setting out some thoughts in writing and reading them there. I am thinking of speaking about the common cause of salvation from evil (hunger, disease, and death) as the meaning of life, about freedom and duty, and about the superiority of life over death (this is because the whole question arose because of suicides). <…>

<…> In writing to you that a great deal of work is being done in the army and that much has been implemented, I had in mind what I saw and heard personally and as a member of the Society of Enthusiasts of Military Knowledge. For example: as a former grenadier of the Moscow regiment, I was very pleased to see at the firing range of the officer rifle school completely new shooting methods, developed there and taught to all captains of the Russian army. Methods that now make it possible to shoot and hit in a way that in my time we not only did not know how and could not, but did not even dream of anything like that. New inventions in the field of radiotelegraphy applicable to underwater and aerial mine attack and defense and wireless telephony, photographic and cinematographic shots of the terrain during a flight from a flying airplane, Captain Skalon's device for day and night shooting without missing, this amazing invention of a Russian officer, and a host of other interesting news in military affairs, new methods of educating soldiers, with the introduction of demonstration crops of land and grain according to the method of Demchinsky70 and others, all this gives the right to say that the army is not at a standstill, but that it is undergoing, although often invisible, but vigorous work. Recently I was at the Society of Zealots at the report of the senator, engineer Lieutenant General von Wendrich "Colonial Policy "Tunisia"". By the way, he told us about the artificial production of rain in Tunisia near the Chott lakes with the help of the Tour pluvigen-engineer M. Dessoliers (see "France Colonial"). These are towers from 20 to 300 meters high, conical in shape, with spiral pipes running from the surface of the water to the top, to collect steam that turns into clouds (see “Journal de Debat” No. 11, 1911). I couldn’t help but think: if only I could tell someone about Karazin’s method—that would be the engineer Ch. Dessolier in Tunisia. He would probably try to implement the method that Arakcheev71 ridiculed so thoroughly that no one in Russia has yet been found to try it.

It was here that you, dear Nikolai Pavlovich, prophesied an earthquake for yourself, writing to me: “In order to stir up modern humanity, disasters are needed, and not like the Sicilian earthquake.” You wrote this to me December 15, and soon you were shaken. I received your letter when the news of the earthquake in Verny had already spread from telegrams in the newspapers72. And I will allow myself to disagree with you again on the basis of the historical experience of mankind. In my opinion, no disasters, not even death itself, can bring mankind to its senses. After all, until now all people have died, everyone has become so accustomed to this that even the very thought of immortality here on earth and the possibility of a universal, consistent resurrection seems madness to people who are encountering such thoughts for the first time. In the same way, mankind has already seen in its lifetime such catastrophes as the Great Flood, the destruction of Lemuria and Atlantis, such earthquakes as those that destroyed the ancient civilizations of Crete, Nineveh, Babylon, such eruptions as Krakatoa, the instantaneous death of forty thousand people in Lisbon, and what do you know—like water off a duck’s back. In my opinion, all these incentives, as already tested, are ineffective. Others must be tried. It is necessary, by means of consistent education of generations, to introduce these ideas into the minds and heads of people, the possibility of immortality here on earth and the possibility and duty of resurrecting all those who have died before. It is necessary to strive so that at least this idea would cease to seem impossible to people, so that humanity would wish to undertake the implementation of them. It would consciously say: “But it is possible not to die! But it is also possible to return life to the dead, starting from the last to the first and gradually increasing with the addition of each resurrected generation.” I dare to acquaint you here with my attempt to explain one Gospel parable, which still confused me in my youth and all the explanations of which by my father, the teachers of the law and even the Great One himself in his book “The Philosophy of the Common Cause” did not satisfy me, did not remove, in my opinion, from the “Master of the House” of Christ’s parable the possibility of accusing Him (may the Lord forgive me) of tyranny. You have already guessed, of course, what parable I am talking about73. I thought about it for a long time, and this is what is written in my notebook: "January 9, 1910. Matthew chapter 20 verses 1-16. Yesterday after morning prayer I read this chapter and it seems to me that verses 1 to 16 inclusive clearly confirm the correctness of Nikolai Feodorovich's interpretation of the teaching on resurrection as a deed intended by God for people. And when the last mortal people, having fulfilled the great covenant of God, become the first immortal people, and the first mortal people, through common efforts and labors, directed by the Providence of God, become the last immortal (being resurrected, starting from the last to the first), then is it not clear that the first in life, who became immortal last, cannot lay claim to and be offended by those called to fulfill the common deed last and who became the first to enter immortality, into the Kingdom of Heaven. And the Master of the house, who left early, is certainly right and fair in the morning to hire workers for His vineyard and, having agreed with the workers for a denarius per day, having paid everyone a denarius, for the denarius is immortality, the payment, the prize, of the common cause, indicated by God to all people. Dear Nikolai Pavlovich: perhaps this reasoning of mine is mistaken, so far I have read it only to Vladimir Alexandrovich alone during his stay with me last January, and he said that one can think like that, but I would be very interested to know your opinion and the opinion of at least one clergyman from among those you respect. I do not have such clergymen acquaintances here, for the indispensable condition [of obtaining this opinion] is their familiarity with the "Philosophy of the Common Cause", and most of you in Verny are probably familiar with it. Regarding the community, I must say that I have read everything that is written in the "Philosophy of the Common Cause", but I remain of my opinion. It is said in the Scripture: by their fruits ye shall know them. Either this community is not what it should be, and you and Nikolai Fyodorovich are talking about an ideal community of ideal people, enlightened by the true light of knowledge and consciously striving for the Goal indicated by God, but such a community has not yet existed in reality, it is still an idea, or this community has already shown itself in history and has led to nothing but the savagery of people. In this case, we must try to organize it according to a new plan, the plan of P.A. Stolypin, by creating separate cultural families, cells, and then uniting them in one common goal. I also read about pomochi and toloki74, but it is strange to me that both Nikolai Feodorovich and you, attacking cities and townspeople, seem to forget that ordinary churches in Rus' were built precisely in cities and by townspeople, and not in villages and hamlets, and could not be built for the simplest reason, due to the lack of people and hands for one-day construction of a church, and if, perhaps, they did build chapels, then, of course, they followed the example of townspeople and the city, and not vice versa. In the chronicles, naturally, there is mention of the construction of ordinary churches in Moscow, Novgorod, Vologda, but I have not had the chance to read about villages. <…> I saw peasant communities in Tambov province, Kozlovsky and Lipetsk districts and then in Mozhaisk, Moscow. I do not know which is worse. This is such an outrage that it turns everything upside down is overcome by the very memory. And are these savages, the product of communal life, capable of perceiving great ideas? In order to wish for eternal life, one must have an idea of ​​a good life, and here old men and women pray to God to send them death as a mercy. Very often I have heard: "If only the Lord would take us away sooner." A common prayer of the elderly community. And to start talking to these people about the resurrection of the fathers will be considered a mockery. But if we translate, as is necessary, the Philosophy of the Common Cause into English and German, then I assure you that there, in England, America and Germany, among the farmers there will be immeasurably more people who will understand and accept the teaching of the Great One, and the desire to resurrect the ancestors will be accessible to them and will not seem a mockery. For our community members, the only consolation is in the teaching about the Last Judgment as the only possible satisfaction of their feelings of justice outraged on earth and vengefulness, and the hope for paradise, from where they will, from the bosom (certainly from the bosom) of Abraham, like poor Lazarus, look at the torments in hell of the rich, oppressors and sinners. And from above all this is sealed with a comforting text: “Vengeance is mine and I will repay” 75. And therefore, paraphrasing you, I will say: in order to preserve and develop all the good that is contained in the human soul, we need culture of the land, and the conditions of the surrounding life, and the soul itself, and only then can we rise to such consciousness as the teaching of the Great One raises. But for the wild community members it is pearls before swine. <…>

I am very interested in your idea of ​​​​publishing an Alphabetical Index. This is an excellent idea. This must be done. It is also necessary to translate the first volume into English and German and publish the second volume of the works of the Great One, ensuring that it does not perish in manuscript form, either from a fire in Vladimir Alexandrovich's wooden apartment or from yours from an earthquake. Unfortunately, Vladimir Alexandrovich, who could wonderfully translate into English, and even more so into German, does not find it necessary to do this, but prefers to reap laurels by giving some lectures to seminarians on Buddhism or by reprinting a second edition of his brochure "Confessions of an Atheist" by Le Dantec, which he sent me again yesterday76. Of course, this is easier for him than publishing the 2nd volume of the Great One. I grieve that I do not have the opportunity to provide this most necessary, in my opinion, matter of publishing and translating the 1st and 2nd volumes with the most primitive support, that is, financial. I read the notes in "New Time" and was outraged to the depths of my soul77. And just like you, I waited for refutations and explanations from Vladimir Alexandrovich, but alas, I did not wait. And in my opinion, it was his duty to the sacred memory of the Great.

<…> On the third day, according to tradition, I went to Kozhevnikov. He told me, among other things, that the publishing house, it seems, "Put", was planning to publish a series of Russian thinkers and admitted that without Nikolai Fedorovich this series would not be complete. Berdyaev is taking on writing about N. F.78. I will tell you better when we meet, about the difficulties and concerns that arise.

Recently, a note appeared in the Russkie Vedomosti that a new issue of the magazine Bibliotekar had come out, in which “Mr. Ginken’s literary report on the late librarian of the Rumyantsev Museum, N. F. Fedorov, gives a full characterization of this idealistic librarian”79. This magazine has not yet reached Moscow; as soon as it appears, I will certainly buy it and bring it. <…>

Dear Nikolai Pavlovich!

I am sending you an “image” of the unforgettable teacher and comforter Nik. Fed. Fedorov81.

The story of this image is as follows. At the end of March, I read in the Russkie Vedomosti an announcement about the contents of Book 1 of the 1911 magazine Bibliotekar. By the way, this announcement said that the book contained a portrait of N. F. and an article about him.

I was very happy about this news, since I had no image of N. F. and did not even know that it existed. I immediately wrote a letter to the editors about sending the book. Having received the book, I went to Sergei Nikanorovich Pryadkin to share my joy.

He suggested that I take several copies from a photographer for you, for Vladimir Aleks<androvich> Kozhevnikov and for us. I had no choice but to sincerely thank S. N.

Unfortunately, the "Portrait" bears little resemblance to N. F. of the time when I knew him, in 1899 and 1900. Nevertheless, he is dear to me.

Sergei Nikanor<ovich> has been feeling unwell for over a year now, he is very weak, and he has a lot of work, and he is straining his last strength. But he has to work: four children, two of whom cause him too much grief [and] suffering...

He most earnestly asks you to send him: 1) Volume 2 of N. F.'s works 2) Your articles about Nikol. Fed. You will greatly oblige him by fulfilling his request.

My health—thank God: no one believes that I am 45 years old.

I have not lost heart, I am not losing heart, and I do not intend to lose heart.

My financial affairs are very deplorable. My earnings (35 rubles) are beggarly.

But this is also a trifle. One thing is bad: I sometimes become angry. I am sure that without meeting, thanks to you, with N. Fed., I would have long ago turned into a half-beast.

For me, N. F. is such a figure that no other can eclipse. I wrote this down in solitary confinement in April and May 1906.

Please do not refuse to inform Serg. Nikanor and me about the origin of the image of N. F. (painted by the artist Pasternak), a copy of which we are sending you.

After all, N. F. did not agree to leave his image, he even refused N. N. Ge's request to paint a portrait of him.

Greetings to Yulia Vladimirovna and the children.

We are all alive and well.
Yours, K. Afonin.

Address: Sergey Nikanor.: Voronezh, Khalyutinskaya, own house.

Mine: Sredne-Smolenskaya St., No. 15.

P. S. I visited your nephew A. Gr. Peterson. He received me very kindly. I plan to visit him again. Maybe he will be able to do something for me.

Dear Nikolai Pavlovich!

Forgive me for writing to you without knowing you personally, but I am prompted to do so by one good thought, which, it seems to me, will be pleasant to you... I am writing to you as a person who knew Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov closely, whom you mention in passing in your memoirs as a "former teacher" published in the "Tolstoy Almanac" published by Sergeenko83.

I have long heard about the remarkable personality that Nik. Fed. was, but this information was more of a fragmentary nature. Your recollections have given something, but still so little that I would like to know more and in more detail about him. I have addressed several people in writing, but no one could tell me anything definite about him. There is not a word about him in the "Encyclopedic Dictionary". Then I turned to Pyotr Alekseevich Sergeenko with a request to share with me information about Fedorov, but he writes to me that he himself cannot tell me anything, but asks me to write to you, noting that you will be happy to give me information about Nik. Fed. and share your memories of him. That is why I am writing to you as a friend of a remarkable person, whom, unfortunately, so few know among us, but whom it would be simply a crime for Russian society to forget. The desire to know about Nik. Fed. is dictated not by simple curiosity. — In our time, dull and aimless, there are so few of those bright lights on which one would gladly concentrate one’s attention. Society lives only for the day, for topical, flickering impressions, as in a cinema, and does not want to look beyond its snail, much less remember those people who in another country would constitute the object, if not of admiration, then at least of conscientious study, which would not allow the image of such a person to disappear from people’s memory. Nik. Fed. is that bright star against the dark background of modernity, on which the eye rests, tired of politics, and malice, and everything that a modern intellectual lives by. Besides, I myself am a native of the city of Bogorodsk, Moscow province, where Nik. Fed. lived for some time. 84 So Bogorodsk with its grey provincial life, devoid of bright colors, should not only know about him, but be proud of him as a person who once lived there. But, of course, neither the second nor the first actually exists, because no one knows about him. And it would be so good to remind at least the residents of a provincial town that in the midst of the same greyness, the "province", there lived a man who strove for truth, beauty, for God. Such reminders are needed, necessary. They make you look back at yourself, "cleanse yourself" a little and discard the formula "that's how everyone lives and lived." - No, not everyone. But in the midst of the same environment lived a man who stood above it and did not recognize this formula.

I could ask my friends to rummage through the school archives, where, perhaps, there is something related to the time of life in Bogorodsk. We have a small newspaper published in Bogorodsk, and it would be possible to write something about Nik. Fed. in it and thus remind people of him and restore the pure image of a bright personality, so unfairly forgotten. — If you, dear Nikolai Pavlovich, sympathize with my idea, I sincerely ask you to respond to my letter. I would ask you to inform me, as much as is possible and not burdensome for you, about everything that concerns the personality of Nik. F., no matter how it is expressed (in your personal recollections, the recollections of other people, etc.). In addition to personal recollections, I ask you to indicate printed sources from which something could also be learned. It would be desirable to have more information concerning the life of Nik. Fed. in Bogorodsk, but everything else is also so important and necessary. I repeat, all this is not necessary for personal self-satisfaction (of course, I will not hide how much I myself want to know about Fedorov), the above lines, I think, have explained, although not quite clearly, my thought.

Of course, it would be wonderful if you yourself compiled a small article. But I dare not ask you about this. Send me the roughest material, and I will use it with great gratitude. What a pity that such a huge distance separates us, otherwise we could discuss everything in person.

Where could I see a portrait of Nick . Fed.? Do you have any photographs? Would you mind sharing copies of some of his letters to you?

I am finishing my letter for now.

I hope that you will respond to my request and provide the information I have requested. — If, however, for some reason you could not or did not wish to inform me of your refusal, I still ask you not to refuse to inform me of your refusal, so that I will not be worried about your failure to receive my letter.

All the best for now.

I send you my warmest regards and look forward to your reply.

Yours sincerely

Ivan Ivanovich Alekseyev.

Moscow, May 3, 1911. Pyotr Alekseevich Sergeenko asks me to convey his love to you, which I am happy to do.

I have written to you all about Bogorodsk, but, of course, people outside this town should know about Nik. Fed.

I will pay all postage by first mail and please do not worry about this.

I will be happy to tell you anything that might interest you about Bogorodsk, where you once lived85, and in general, to render you any service, no matter what it may be.

Dear Nikolai Pavlovich!

I received your postcard and after some time Fedorov's book - "The Philosophy of the Common Cause". - If you only knew how grateful I am to you for it. I must tell you that after sending a letter to you, I visited Vl. Al. Kozhevnikov (unknown until now), where I received some information about Nik. Fed. Vl. Al. was so kind that he gave me the book he published about Nik. Fed., which serves as an introduction to the "Philosophy of the Common Cause" you sent me. I read the first one carefully, and it raised such a swarm of thoughts in me that it is difficult to say what struck me most in Nik. Fed.'s worldview.

I will only say that a rare book has made one think and reflect so much on what has been read. What is so dear and valuable is that everywhere, in all of N. F-ch's articles, he obviously emphasizes action. This call to action is so necessary now, when our Russian society, disappointed by unfulfilled hopes, has fallen into a kind of stupor, Buddhist contemplation, fatalism, the attitude of "I don't give a damn about anything." And that is why it is so necessary that the thoughts of the unforgettable righteous philosopher become generally accessible, well-known... I heard from Vl. Al. Kozhevnikov that Berdyaev intends to write his biography in the fall... This is so necessary. It is even more necessary to collect a volume of memoirs about him, so that with the death of the few people close to him who remain alive, everything that gives the personality of the deceased such a bright aura of righteousness does not go to the grave.

I was struck and attracted by the view of the regulation of nature, the tasks of education and the relationship between teachers and students. The view of military service, which is supposed to turn everything upside down, is simply astounding. This is the solution to the question of war and peace. This is what should have been put at the head of the sermon of the recently formed peace societies in Moscow and St. Petersburg, calling for disarmament.

And a new interpretation of the question of humanism, of progress, of Socrates' formula "know thyself", of the moral duty of all educated people to share their knowledge with the less educated, not in the form of some handouts, which happens in our Sunday schools, but by means of universal educational service, like military service.

Now, having learned the quintessence of N. F-ch's teaching, I have begun to read the book that was sent to me, "The Philosophy of the Common Cause," and I am thinking of reading it in the summer... I would very much like to have another copy of this book and the book published by Kozhevnikov, in order to give them to the local city library. It is absolutely necessary for local residents to become interested in Fedorov's personality.

I must sadly inform you that I cannot convey your greetings to N. F-ch's former student: V. I. Elagin shot himself about 3 years ago. His brother N. I., whom you mentioned, also died, but I have not lost hope of finding people who knew N. F-ch. Tomorrow I am going to the school to inspect the archives: maybe I will find something there.

You know, there is one thing that does not satisfy me in N. F-ch's teaching: it is about the resurrection of ancestors. Or rather, not the teaching itself about this, which I sympathize with and believe in. But I could never understand (from Kozhevnikov's book), how, in what ways humanity itself (not God) can resurrect its ancestors literally, really, as it is said, for example, in the Gospel. By what measures to achieve this. I could not find these "practical" (roughly speaking) methods and proofs of their correctness in Kozhevnikov. Maybe I will find them in the "Philosophy of the Common Cause". Also, why does N. F. pay so little [attention] to questions of sex, this, after all, a powerful source of life, the correct regulation of which he has been waiting for a long time... Maybe there is something about this in other articles that have not yet been published?

I read with interest your brochures about Rodionov's book: "Our Crime" and Tolstoy's letter to you86. I think I'll buy R<odinov>'s book and read it... Is it possible to somehow get a portrait of N. F-ch and where can I do it? Is it possible to get it from you? I won't write anything else for now. I'm hurrying to send this letter. Yours sincerely, I. Alekseyev.

Dear Nikolai Pavlovich!

I don't know if you received the letter from me that I sent you last summer, at least I haven't received an answer to it yet.

I am again asking, as I did then, about sending the works of Nik. Fed. Fedorov to the library of the city of Bogorodsk. Have the second and subsequent volumes of his works been published? Also, has your collection dedicated to Fedorov87, which you told me about in one of your letters, been published? It would be very interesting to read it.

Recently I had the chance to see a portrait-sketch of Fedorov, attached to the article: "The Ideal Librarian" in the magazine "Librarian" for 1911, No. 1. I heard that the death mask was removed from Nik. Fed. I wonder where it is kept now? And are there any photographs of it? I have heard that the artist Pasternak intends to begin painting Nik. Fed.'s portrait in oils soon88.

I recently looked through the archives of the Bogoroditsky School for 1863 and 1864, but I did not find anything particularly interesting there... You asked me to report the year of N. F.-ch's birth. In 1863, as it says in the form, N. F-ch was 35 years old, therefore he was born in 1828. I also came across your signatures among the papers...

I often think now that we need a biography of Nik. F-ch, written in simple, clear language, a biography not of a philosopher and thinker, but simply of a man. We have many philosophers and thinkers, but, strangely enough, so few people. Such books have and will have an enormous educational influence.

I wish you would take on this matter, following the example of the biography of Doctor Haass, written by Koni89, which, of course, you know.

In general, it seems to me that both Haas and Nik. F-ch have many common features, which make us dwell on the bright name of Nik. F-ch with special love and warmth.

I still haven’t read the book of works, Volume I, but I read it little by little in my free time and am amazed by his thoughts… Recently, Professor Bulgakov in the published Volume II of his works placed an article about Nik. F-ch under the title: “The Enigmatic Thinker”, with brief excerpts from his works90.

In general, our society is gradually beginning to take an interest in the name of N. F-ch.

I still want the city of Bogorodsk to take an interest in the memory of F-v.

Recently, with this sole purpose in mind, I wrote a short article about Fedorov and placed it in a newspaper published in Bogorodsk under the title “In Blessed Memory of the Righteous Philosopher”…91 It would be good if you wrote at least something for this newspaper and thereby reminded society of the remarkable man who once lived…

Yes, I don’t think I told you in my letter that I was a student technician… M<aybe> b<e>, you thought that I was already an elderly man… I think that our written communications will remain just as good as before…

I repeat that the more I get to know N. F-tch, who once lived, the more surprised I am at how little and almost no one knows about him… M<aybe> this should only be in Russia…

All the best for now.

I await your letter.

I.I. Alekseev.

1911, September 20.

In Kozhevnikov's book it is said that N. F-ch, while in the Rum<yantsev> library, attracted a Japanese man to work. Do you remember who he was? Isn't his last name Kopiy? I am slightly acquainted with this Japanese man, the translator of Laotza's works into Russian02. He is no longer in Moscow...

Dear Nikolai Pavlovich!

I have received your letter of November 11 and am in a hurry to answer it. But first I want to thank you for your kind, heartfelt letter... I am very glad that you liked my lines, although I thought otherwise. I will be glad to write to you in the future, for I am amazed by N. F-ch's teaching, as if by a new revelation. But I repeat that at the same time I cannot sincerely say that I could accept it in its entirety. Everything is so grandiose that you somehow do not believe in the possibility of the world of people fulfilling this covenant, as N. F-ch depicts it, although logically you come to the conclusion that you agree with his arguments. Yesterday at a meeting of the Christian student circle, of which I am a member, I met your son Mikhail Nikolaevich... Someday we will get together and talk, although this is unlikely to happen in the near future, since we live at opposite ends of Moscow and are both very busy. Well, the only important thing is that there is a familiar person with whom you can talk about the issue of interest, and when this happens is not the essence. You need to think more, let your thoughts settle, and then give them a go... I see that you have spent a lot of time writing to me and I thank you for this, and I myself am only afraid to write you a lot, lest I interfere with your studies. Your son told me that, on the contrary, you would be pleased if I wrote, which is why I decided to turn to you again...

First, I must say that N. F-ch's view of the sexual question has now become quite clear to me. From it I see that he did not have a negative attitude toward marriage. — Yes, it is so important to distinguish between negative, passive virginity, which, in the end, is not such a merit, and — positive, where there is no place for passivity, inertia, where the question is about action. And I will even say — it is easier for a man to be in the position of a city. It is easier to take positions, even under fire, than to merely defend them. In action the soul is tempered, in inaction it weakens, liquefies, becomes "gelatinous".

A new view of death is so important precisely for our modern society, burdened with literary excess, as the Roman patricians were burdened with them before the decline of Rome. — I recently had to look through the works of Georges Rodenbach (Moscow, ed. Sablin, vol. I and II), where the writer speaks of death as something intoxicating, he compares it to a poisonous flower, but at the same time beautiful, the scent of which mankind inhales like ambrosia03. He reconciles himself to death, praising it in hymns, but this is not enough, he has poeticized it, which is already very bad... What a contrast, indeed: Fedorov and Georges Rodenbach... What attracts me to N. F-ch's teaching is that he does not have a negative attitude toward science, assigning it such a huge place. In our country, religion often turns into some kind of mysticism, theosophy, into something extremely abstract, and I know that many are repelled by such a view. I do not deny internal religious experience, but religion cannot be filled with it, otherwise we can end up in the position of an Indian fakir, frozen in contemplation, having forgotten in this state all other people and, strictly speaking, almost himself... This clearly formulated formula is so important: "one must live not only for oneself, but also not for others, but with everyone and for everyone." Many will agree with the first part, but the second makes a strange impression on a thoughtful person... "What, you deny altruism!", one student said to me when Nick repeated this basic idea to him. F-cha...

Another thing that is dear to me in the thoughts of N. F-cha is his attitude to nature. I completely agree with his regulation and completely join it. It is so important to establish his view of nature, which man dares to make such as he wants... The tone of a reptile - man must change in front of blind nature. Not return to nature, not renounce thought, but bring thought into nature. What a grandiose spectacle, what a boundless space opens up for science, for scientists... Here is the application of their thinking, which is now not noticed. When reading Fedorov's book, you want to soar into the heights, without leaving the earth, your head rises upward, as opposed to reading, for example, the works of Rousseau, when, according to Voltaire, you want to crawl on all fours...

Here again are two names, both talking about nature - Jean Rousseau and Nikolai Fedorov... What a contrast, what a difference in views, and when comparing them, you immediately feel the truthfulness and fairness of the words of the I-st, and not the 1-st... In general, it would be good to make such comparisons. From them, the necessity of such a Fedorov-like, if one can say so, view of nature, death, etc. is somehow more clearly visible.

I am very interested in how our clergy relates to the views of N. F-ch, if only his most prominent representatives know them?

Here's another thing: it cannot, of course, be denied that often and almost always this or that direction of thinking and the subsequent activity that follows from this thinking are influenced by some incidents from the personal life[3] of this person or events from the life of society or an entire state... And so, observing the force of conviction with which N. F-ch thunders against death, convincing that it is a consequence of sin and, consequently, is not something absolute, the thought arises: were there not incidents in N. F-ch's life that would have aggravated this question?.. Of course, this probably pertains more to a future monograph about him, but an explanation of this question will facilitate the very understanding of F<edor>ov's teaching... It seems to me that something happened in F<edor>ov's life that forced him to pay attention to the side that everyone avoids (i.e., the question of death). <…>

<…> I am very interested: does any of the peasants, not spoiled by city life, know about N. F-ch's teaching. It would be very bad if this teaching were only good for us, intellectuals... How will a simple Russian peasant treat it? Everything great and true is always simple, and if an uneducated peasant understands it, then we can say, although of course not definitively, that it is at least worthy of attention. Undoubtedly, one cannot be guided entirely by this criterion, but it seems to me that such a test is necessary. Has such an experiment been carried out? <…>
***

I asked to find out about old lady Al. Kornil. Mikhailova (I have not been home for a long time myself), but I have not received anything yet, when I receive it, I will let you know right away. - I have received information that in Ryazan (own house on Sadovaya St.) there lives the widow of a former librarian Maria Konstantinovna Lebedeva94, it would be interesting to contact her for information regarding N. F-ch. Please send me, if possible, copies of Tolstoy's letters to you, where he mentions Fedorov.

I am very grateful for the future sending of your articles. Since they will probably be published for a long time, I would very much like to ask you to send me what is printed now[4], and you could kindly send the rest later. I would very much like to get acquainted with them, especially since there will be a free time.

I don’t remember how I wrote when I said that N. F-ch’s call was, in a certain sense, violence. I don’t remember what I attributed it to… In all likelihood, I wanted to say the following, and if I didn’t say it in the letter, I’ll say it here anyway. — There are people who have lived a long time, are tired of life, have seen and experienced a lot, and for them death is a blessing, and of course they cannot be blamed for this. Remember “Job,” who died “in an old age, full of days”95. And so it seems to me that if we resurrect these people (if this really happens when), resurrect them without their consent and their will, then won’t this be, in a certain sense, violence. This is what I wanted to emphasize, I completely agree with your words about the brotherhood of people, about unity, the realization of which we see in the Holy Trinity.

That’s all I think I wanted to tell you. I think you will understand... I repeat, I recognize N. F-ch's book as very valuable, which cannot be ignored, and I am surprised that nothing has been heard about it. After all, I found out about it by chance in a roundabout way, and it took me a lot of effort to get to you to get it... If there are attacks on the book, then, it seems to me, there is no need to be especially embarrassed, I always repeat to myself the words of Lombroso:

"A book that does not meet with any resistance cannot be of great value."

I think in a few days I will go to Vl. A. Kozhevnikov for his book for the Bogorodsk library, which he promised me when I visited him once in the spring. M<aybe> b<e> some of the Bogorodsk residents will be interested in the thoughts of Nikolai Fyodorovich.

Do many people contact you about this book? It would be interesting to know what attitude these thoughts are receiving in our society…

Well, it seems I have bored you with my writings. I will be glad to receive a letter from you.

All the best.

Yours sincerely
I. Alekseev

I felt ashamed, in fact, that I did not use Fedorov either in my work101 or in my lectures, but arrived at so much “with my own mind”. When will his 2nd volume come out? Probably, it will also contain articles on philosophy, which are most interesting to me? For some reason, I think that your 2nd volume about Fedorov will never come out. Right? <…>

In this I completely agree with Kozhevnikov. He wanted to telegraph you not to do this. <…>

Dear Nikolai Pavlovich!

In June 1911, during my stay in the city of Nizhniy Lomov in the Penza province with Elizaveta Pavlovna Dobrotina109 (as a deputy from the District for conducting tests), I had the opportunity to become acquainted with your brochure, “The Truth about Count L.N. Tolstoy”110, and then, under its influence, with the first volume of the works published by you of N.F. Fedorov, sent to me thanks to the kind assistance of Elizaveta Pavlovna.

The impression that N.F. Fedorov's views make is difficult to describe: his understanding of Christianity, the relationship between religion and science, man and nature, is a genuine revelation for readers and, one must think, true light.

In the preface to the book, references were made to V.A. Kozhevnikov's articles about N.F. Fedorov, published in the "Russian Archive" for 1904, 1905, 1906; they were obtained, and when reading them it became clear that the first volume does not contain all of Fedorov's works. Allow me to bother you as the publisher of his works with a request to answer whether you have published any more volumes besides the first, and if so, to assist in acquiring them, at least in one copy. I have to bother you because your publication is not intended for sale. If it were not too much trouble, I would ask you to send the book cash on delivery, or as you find convenient, to the following address: Penza, Real School, teacher Dmitriy Filippov. Popov. Upon receipt, the book will be handed over for safekeeping and public use to the fundamental library of the Penza Real School. It would also be very desirable to know how and where to acquire your brochures about N. F. Fedorov, as someone who knew him and his teachings closely.

Acquaintance with the works of N. F. Fedorov is especially valuable for teachers, so that when teaching, perhaps, involuntarily, they do not lay false foundations in the worldview of youth.

Please accept the assurance of my sincere respect.

Teacher of History and Geography D.F. Popov.

<…> I am now reading Kozhevnikov’s book about Feodorov, and then I will read Feodorov himself. I have swallowed what I needed from Kireevsky and Khomyakov. In a word, I am thinking of starting to revise the book upon my return from Moscow112 <…>

<…> On July 15, D.F. Popov was passing through Penza. When you sent him telegrams to Penza113, he was in St. Petersburg at a pedagogical exhibition.

He made a very sympathetic impression on me. His interest in Nik. Fyodor, it seems solid to me. In Penza he managed to interest several of his students in it—senior realists and young people attending evening classes, where Popov teaches history. He wanted to write to You in Voronezh114. <…> He was very sorry that he was unable to meet You, and in the future he certainly wants to see You. <…>

<…> I expect something from You about inner experience. I think that if, indeed, thanks to ascetic feats an inner sense of Christ in oneself is achieved, then this path is not the only one and, thus, not obligatory, but, on the contrary, exceptional and temporary. The main and obligatory path, common to all and excluding no one, is the common cause, as N. F. understands it, with the fulfillment of this cause, undoubtedly, is connected the feeling that Christ is with us, and it is no less than the ascetic, and, probably, greater and stronger. Does not the construction of ordinary churches prove this, when each person who participated in the construction, no matter who he was before that time, was reborn, became better, purer, stronger, felt the action of God's power in himself? And now, in my opinion, it is clear how much more preferable this path is. On the ascetic path, a person seeks solitude (“if only he were always in solitude,” says the wanderer in M. A. Novoselov: “The Forgotten Path,” [p.] 32 115) and does not fulfill God’s commandment about unity. But the other path requires unification and action. This—can one doubt it?—is precisely the path that Christ bequeathed. Now I have been brazen enough to read a passage in N. F-ch that directly speaks against what M. A. Novoselov advocates. This is in relation to Luther’s words: “O man! Imagine Christ and contemplate…” (p. 187). “If man’s salvation depends on such an idea, contemplation, then man must completely surrender to contemplation or surrender to it as often as possible; however, even such a limitation cannot be allowed and only proves the contradiction contained in the very teaching about salvation by faith." And further: one can devote oneself entirely to salvation only when "every deed is turned into a means of salvation." <…>

<…> The arrival of N. P. Peterson distracted all my attention and took up all my time with work on editing the second volume of the works of Nikolai Fedorovich Fedorov. For a month and a half, Peterson and I worked diligently: we distributed the manuscripts among ourselves and prepared for publication each of our separate articles, this took up all our time, namely from 8, sometimes from 7 o'clock in the morning until 5 in the evening, of course, with a break for lunch and a short rest; and in the evenings there was joint checking and correction of what has been done. The work was difficult: to reconstruct articles from scraps of manuscripts and from numerous versions and give them an orderly appearance. But there was also much that was attractive in this resurrection of many valuable, and often highly talented thoughts. Thank God, the work went faster and, I think, more successfully than expected. Up to 500 pages are ready for printing, so I hope to start printing in the fall (only the correspondence, which is very important in content, remains unprepared for publication). I think that this second volume will turn out to be significantly different from the first and will be easier to read: short and very diverse articles, often sparkling with wit and originality of expression, with the usual thoughtfulness of the "old man", make a completely different impression than the ponderous large articles of the first volume. I am very happy that God helped me to fulfill this side of the duty that lay upon me. <…>

<…> I can report the following regarding the Innocent Brotherhood: it is affiliated with the Cathedral; its members are primarily priests, teachers of theological schools; it has a very good — perhaps the best in Penza — library, which is also affiliated with the Cathedral; the library is currently managed by a teacher at the theological seminary, Mr. Khvoshchev; it is open to members three times a week; about a month ago I went to the library, talked about N. F. Fedorov and how his and his works could be acquired for the library; I will try to see Khvoshchev again in a few days.

About two weeks ago I received the following request from St. Petersburg from your former Penza realist, now an auditor at agricultural courses, who had heard about N. F. Fedorov: “Send me Fedorov as soon as possible, if possible. The full volume. We had such a dispute with the owner, the male and female students over it that we formed a whole circle to study it. We ran all over St. Petersburg and couldn’t find it. And everyone is waiting impatiently for me to send it. We decided to read it and maybe even publish it. So, can you send it, and quickly…” Since there were only two copies in Penza at the time, a reply followed with a reference to the “Russian Archive” for 1904, 5, 6, Bulgakov’s article in the book “Two Cities” — “The Mysterious Thinker” — and with advice to contact Mr. Kozhevnikov at the given address for the book. Now I have the opportunity to satisfy their demand, if it has not yet been satisfied from Moscow…

Recently I read about N.F. Fedorov in the chapter in Trubetskoy’s article about Solovyov, published in “Problems of Philosophy and Psychology”, in the latest book…116

I will ask you, Nikolai Pavlovich, to inform me about the status of the question of printing the second volume of N.F. Fedorov, the republication of Mr. Kozhevnikov’s book; many people are asking. I am very interested in the feedback you received from my fellow villager about his impressions of Fedorov's teaching. <…>

NB. I am sending another feedback about N.F. Fedorov, belonging to a young man who graduated from the realist last year, now a student at the neuropsychological institute. The method of carrying out the work of universal salvation is indicated—physical (regulation of the world), but others are not considered, which Fedorov has, although, perhaps, less developed: mystical (methods of attracting Providence through us by faith), personal (labor improvement of individuality by reason), social (creation and preparation of large and small social unions, organized according to the type of the Trinity, on the principles of autocracy instead of oppression or law-making, mutual knowledge and (instead of money) a selfless-voluntary feeling of love (instead of necessity or benefit) and archaeological (resurrection in thought and <1 illegible> ancestors...). Faith (not only personal, but conciliar) without a common cause is dead... See also the review of N. F. in Trubetskoy's article: he condemns the introduction of an element of immanence into the understanding of Christian teaching. Then faith remains without a common cause...

Dear Sir!

I am sending you the magazine “Novoye Vino”118. From it you will see how much [is similar] in our teaching with the teaching of Fedorov.

Therefore—I kindly ask you to send us (as soon as possible) a portrait of the late philosopher for inclusion in the magazine. His book and yours about him (for review). And it would also be nice if you wrote an article about him (characterization of his personality and teaching).

With respect,

<…> The director of the teachers' seminary and the assistant inspector of the theological seminary became interested in N. F. Fedorov; they took the first volume. I am interested in how the printing of the second volume is going and will eagerly await its publication. Perhaps you will receive an appeal regarding the first volume for the library of the Theological and Teachers' Seminary…

The address of the peasant you wrote about in your last letter: Korablino station of the Ryazan-Uralsk railway with transfer to the village of Pekhlets — to the peasant Vasily Nikolaevich Khomutsky…119 It happens on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the Roman house novyh to prepare a word; your book and N.F. Fedorov inspire and help a lot, especially the ideas of voluntariness, universal kinship and the common cause of regulating blind nature... <…>

Recently there was a lecture by Gusev120 about L.N. Tolstoy; it seemed insignificant after the comprehensive N.F. Fedorov; I asked Gusev several questions about N.F. Fedorov, from which it is clear that Gusev, and maybe L.N.) did not know N.F. Fedorov's book in the original; Gusev said that L. N. did not sympathize with N. F.'s teachings, but deeply respected him as a person...

Highly respected Nikolai Pavlovich!

The 2nd volume of N. F. F. has been published. As a reader and admirer of it, on behalf of myself and others I know, I express my deep gratitude to you as the publisher of the 2nd volume. I wrote the same to V. A. Kozhevnikov.

V. A. Kozhevnikov kindly sent me the 2nd volume, and then another 20 copies for distribution in Penza, according to my wishes. Half of them have already been sold out, the rest I think to give, together with 6 copies of your book received from Alexandra Semenovna, to the bookstores of Penza and to the book zemstvo warehouse, and I am more than sure that they will soon be sold out. <…> I will bother readers with a question, perhaps unnecessary, whether the first volume will be reissued and when we can expect the third volume…

N. F. F. became interested — our well-known public figure in Penza, N. F. Yezersky, a member of the 1st State Duma, took the first volume from me, promised to study it and even read an essay about it at the Lermontov Society. I will let you know if the essay takes place. Personally, I read the second volume with reverence… <…>

NB. The speech, composed in the spirit of N. F. F. ("new Slavophile"?), was a success: they sincerely thanked…
I. I. DOROFEEVA — I. P. BRIKNICHEV121
1913. First half of the year. Moscow

Well, my dear! After righteous labors I can talk with you. I spent four whole hours with Chernogubov, we talked and talked... Of course, he talked more. I can't remember everything exactly, but I'll try... First, I said that you, Gorsky and others live in Odessa. Fedorov's ideas are dear to you and you want to continue them, develop them and act in this area. He says that he doesn't have any materials—he gave everything he had to Kozhevnikov—he said to write to Peterson, since he has the most information and letters. He showed me Fedorov's mask and Pasternak's drawing of it. If the editors need to have one, then let him indicate the size of the photograph[5] and allocate some money for it—and he, Chernogubov, will take it from Fischer—they won't make it for him expensively, since he gives them a lot of work. He can't write anything in any form or under any circumstances for various reasons and considerations. But when you are in Moscow, I asked you to go to him - he will be very happy to talk about Fedorov, about Vl. Solovyov and others.

I met N. F., he says, under the following circumstances. I was very fond of Fet-Shenshin, spent almost 6 years collecting information from his biography, various facts and other data, traveled to different cities where Fet was, and worked in the Rumyantsev Museum - Fedorov noticed with what zeal I was trying to reproduce everything that concerns the deceased Fet, he liked it, and then this acquaintance began. Nikolai Fyodor was interested in Fet's illegitimacy (this is my expression, I do not remember how Chernogubov said it, but this is the idea), he treated this fact with sympathy, since he himself was illegitimate - he is the son of one of the princes. Gagarins and, it seems, a peasant woman. Once, - Nik. Fyodor said, - Prince Gagarin took him to Count Rostovtsev, and I, he says, ran away from the reception room.

All my life, says Chernogubov, I looked at Nik. Fyodor with my mouth open, with great curiosity, and thought that I would never see such a person again.

Nik. Fyodor never took care of himself, he walked around in short trousers, in an undershirt, some kind of black scarf from the 40s around his neck and a short black coat with a faded back, or a cheerful gray one - all this was bought on Sukharevka, second-hand, he was always huddled in rooms, and not even in a room, but rather like some kind of closet. He died—he was over 80 years old, had no front teeth, but power, and most importantly youthful, fiery eyes. Our servants said—here came this old man with terrible eyes. I, he said, think that he was more powerful than the prophet Elijah. Fedorov spoke, peppering his speech with foreign words, etc., in a word, in a professorial language, and how pitiful and helpless he was when some Old Believers came out—with them he did not know at all how to behave. He considered everyone, everyone, his enemy who did not agree with him, and did not care the more he had to talk to him... The more talented the opponent was, the more harmful he considered him to be to himself. He was very intolerant, terribly suspicious, impossible, it was difficult to get along with him for more than two days... He was not a quiet philosopher, he was an angry prophet... Lately he could not stand Tolstoy, he clenched his fists, swore with foam at the mouth - hated, "hypocrite", he said, "ugh", swore with foul words... He spoke about Solovyov to Chernogubov - he is a Jesuit, he says, keep away from him. About Kozhevnikov - in the morning, he says, he pays tribute to Orthodoxy: he kneels, and in the evening he defends Catholicism - he writes articles, essays... 123 Friends at Nik. Fed. there was no... he was an ascetic... not adapted to life, like a 9-year-old boy... His sphere of feelings was narrow, not like Dostoevsky, who wrote that he shared his views - no, he did not share them and did not understand Fedorov. Dostoevsky is broad, scattered, and Fedorov, like a shot, direct, at one target... Fedorov did not accept or recognize any disputes or objections. If you agree with him, he listens to you and winds this on the core of his unity with people, and if not, then you are his enemy... Fedorov was an atheist, Schopenhauer, Hartmann124 and the like were close to him, but he did not like the end of their theory, immersion in oblivion - he said, this cannot be done - we must try everything, and if it does not work out - well, then it is another matter. People do not risk anything - because in the extreme case - instead of half-animals and half-men, the ranks of scientists and nobles will go to the grave. His only hope was not in God, nor in the forces of nature, but only in people, if people resurrect ... He did not recognize either Orthodoxy or autocracy ... but he reasoned like this ... if they drove us into barracks - well, so what, we accept the barracks, but we must do something completely different in it ... People should all be soldiers (he recognizes the army in this way), but they must fight not with their own kind, but with the forces of nature ... Well, if the army attacked England and plunders, destroys it - this is good, since England is the center of trade, and commerce is its enemy. Well, Jonah, a short break, Kostya came from [1 illegible] with "Don Juan" and interrupted my thought...

Fedorov, using the forms and terms of Orthodoxy and autocracy, acted like a great man - wanting to unite everyone and everything, he did not break with either Orthodoxy or autocracy.

Chernogubov said that he parted ways with Kozhevnikov after he published Fedorov's book (he made him an Orthodox, which Fedorov never was). Nik. Fed. was not a theist... He left no notes behind - except for correspondence125. He sometimes wrote on scraps of paper, these were short phrases either without a predicate or without a noun - only understandable to him, Fedorov... He spoke passionately, his whole being spoke to him... He was never seen with a book of fiction, he never read poetry and did not like it.

Kozhevnikov, says Chernogubov, is a stingy man, he spent 1000 rubles on Fedorov's first book, and the second one costs 2.50 - so, let's return it - and the letters, he says, I think he will give them and first publish them in a magazine.

Well, you know Kozhevnikov too well to write to you from Chernogubov's words.

About Solovyov Vl. spoke—he was a talented private lecturer at the Moscow University—as many, many can be now, his success was not due to his philosophy, but was entirely due to his physical and poetic side—Soloviev flirted with everyone and everything... he always took pictures of himself as handsome, did a beautiful hairstyle, made a beautiful moustache and beard... He wore a long black frock coat, was very elegant—he was mainly popular with the ladies—he had neither students nor just female admirers, he only had Magdalenes, for example, such as Tolstaya, Durnovo, Khitrovo126—they had tried everything in life, there was nothing left and they took the last pose of sitting at the feet of a charming young teacher—as now pearls, diamonds and balls do not suit Elizabeth and she put on an old robe and a wooden cross...127 Soloviev is not a philosopher, he is a poet... He knew all the poets by heart and always quoted them... he sprinkled his speech with "strong expressions" - for which the ladies especially loved him... Once, says Chernogubov, I went to Fet to get the correspondence from Soloviev's desk with Fet - Soloviev gave the key, this was 7 years after Fet's death... I open the desk and oh, amazement! a whole pile of women's letters to Soloviev and a smell, like from a perfume shop.

If Solovyov had been given a haircut, his beard and moustache taken off, and he had put on short trousers like Fedorov, and had been seated somewhere on Malaya Tsaritsynskaya, Solovyov would have burst and would not have been a philosopher, but would have been left only as a private lecturer at the Moscow University.

Fate played a joke on him after all... When he died, they cut his hair, trimmed his moustache - he had disgusting Negro lips - well, that didn't depend on him.

He was not Fedorov's student - he flirted with his teaching, as with many others.

Well, I'm tired.

I think that's all.

You'll talk to him in person and then you'll be able to extract something interesting for publication.

I kiss you hard.

Please forgive my mistakes.

Nina.

I look forward to further x instructions.

July 21, 1913. Zaraysk

<…> Now it can be established with certainty that Fedorov's work, which prompted Solovyov's first letter, was read by Solovyov in the autumn of 1881129. By that time it was a notebook containing 150-200 quarters, i.e. about 40-50 sheets of writing paper, with folded margins; this notebook was written in my unattractive, but clear and compact handwriting; and only later did it grow almost twice as big or even more, but all the most important things were already in it then, and were brighter, more definite than in the final version: Fedorov had the disadvantage of getting carried away with details, to the side and weakening the general with episodic insertions. And the time that Solovyov spent reading this notebook (“I read your manuscript with greed and spiritual delight, devoting the whole night and part of the morning to this reading” — from Solovyov’s first letter) was quite sufficient to read it attentively, and not just glance through it. And so I say boldly that, having read this notebook, Solovyov was in complete agreement with what was set out in it, he agreed precisely with the method of carrying out the general resurrection, because the whole essence of the teaching on the resurrection is precisely in this method, and Solovyov could not fail to understand this, otherwise he would have to be suspected of even greater incomprehension than you have me. Fedorov himself, in one of his letters, which will be published in the 3rd volume, says that the doctrine of resurrection “is not a dogma, but a method, as opposed to mysticism, which is dogmatism without any proof” 130. Solovyov became acquainted with this method, having read the notebook mentioned above, and expressing agreement with everything he read, he agreed with precisely that method, the way in which resurrection should be accomplished. Otherwise, what would the words with which Solovyov ends his letter mean; - having recognized Fedorov as his teacher and spiritual father, Solovyov says: “But your goal is not to make proselytes or to found a sect, but to save all of humanity by a common cause, and for this, first of all, it is necessary for your project to become generally recognized. What immediate means can lead to this - that is what, mainly, I would like to talk with you about at our meeting.” But Soloviev's agreement did not last long; soon Soloviev came to his senses and presented various objections. However, even after these objections, when meeting with Fedorov and talking with him, Soloviev again came to complete agreement with him, and this to such an extent that one day Fedorov asked Soloviev why he, recognizing the resurrection as the goal in which the whole meaning of the life of the human race, did not want to say this directly and make a call for the implementation of this goal? And to this question Fedorov heard the following answer: “And what will M. M. Stasyulevich say then, he will call me crazy”...131 Soloviev was most afraid of seeming ridiculous, and in our time, a time of complete collapse, when everyone has broken up into separate units, nothing can be funnier than the thought that “through us, through rational beings, nature will achieve the fullness of self-awareness and self-government, will recreate everything that was destroyed and is being destroyed by its blindness and will thereby fulfill the will of God, its Creator, becoming His likeness” (from Fedorov’s letter, which will be published in the 3rd volume)132. This idea is ridiculous for our time already because its implementation requires the complete unification of all living beings, of the entire human race, requires unification in the image and likeness of the Holy Trinity, requires complete unity of all with complete independence of each individual, unity without oppression and independence without discord, requires the conversion of all into those who know and everything into an object of knowledge, and for this it is necessary to eliminate the division into learned and unlearned, into educated and uneducated, into intelligentsia and the people, and first of all the privilege of knowledge, appropriated by the class of learned people, must be destroyed. Only the conversion of all into those who know will destroy property inequality. And is this idea not a ridiculous utopia for our time?! And so, from time to time, logically agreeing with N. F. Fedorov that only in this lies the goal and meaning of the life of the human race and the whole universe, V. S. Solovyov could not bring himself to admit openly that he agreed with this ridiculous idea, and, by the way, he was afraid that M. M. Stasyulevich would call him crazy and not let him sit at his round table. It turns out that Stasyulevich had a certain day of the week when the chosen few gathered at his round table, and V. S. Solovyov was also admitted to their midst, but he apparently played the role of enfant terrible there and obviously considered it a special honor, while in the circles of Muscovites, Slavophiles and free from this affliction, Solovyov was accepted as a serious, important person. At Stasyulevich's they allowed and excused Solovyov some liberties; but he knew that this had its limits, and seriously, directly, openly, and not vaguely expressed recognition of the duty of resurrection, requiring action, implementation, he would not be forgiven there.

This was Solovyov's attitude to Fedorov's idea. This is all I wanted to say in my note, now published in the 3rd book of the journal “Problems of Philosophy and Psychology”, and never considered Solovyov a true disciple of Fedorov, which he expressed in the words: “at least immediately after reading the manuscript, Solovyov was carried away by Fedorov’s realism” (p. 407). For me, however, it is certain - I repeat this once again - that, converging with Fedorov, Solovyov agreed with him and agreed not only in the idea, but also in the very method of realizing this idea, although, having moved away from Fedorov and having met Mr. Lopatin, he could, by the nature of his nature, laugh at what he was now only recognizing[6].

On page 418 of your reply to me you say that Fedorov, “although he calls the resurrection of death an absurdity, dreams of using knowledge to put together the bodies of the fathers as they were at their death, in other words, to resurrect the unglorified, spiritual body” 133. “And this is not an accident,” you say further, “for a thinker who rejects everything mystical as sorcery, the natural, scientific method of resurrection cannot lead to any result other than the reanimation of corpses.” What, however, does this mean? As long as the breath of life is in a person, he is not a corpse; why then, when the breath of life returns to what has become a corpse, why will it still be a corpse, why will this be the reanimation of a corpse, and not of the man who only turned into a corpse because the breath of life flew away from him? And why will this, according to you, be the resurrection of death? Was the resurrection of Lazarus a resurrection of a corpse? Did the resurrected Lazarus have a glorified body? And will everyone at the general resurrection rise in glorified bodies, and not in those in which they died?! In that case, what kind of resurrection will this be—will it not be a new creation? But creation is an exclusively divine matter, and how can one speak of some kind of divine-human matter of resurrection, how can one speak of (p. 419 of your answer to me) resurrection as a joint, collective matter of God and man?!.. According to Fedorov’s thought, which is consistent with the thought of the prophet Ezekiel and, one must assume, with the universal Christian thought, the dead will rise in those very bodies in which they died; but, according to Fedorov, they will be resurrected by those who have already achieved immortality, i.e. such a state in which there will be no continuous expenditure and renewal, there will be no need to feed on other organisms, killing the lower creature (your words), there will be no childbirth, i.e. the dead will be resurrected by those who have managed and succeeded in transforming their flesh from a soul body to a spiritual body - why should the resurrected, although they will be resurrected in the same flesh in which they died, remain in the same state in which they were, and cannot reach such a transformation of the flesh as their resurrectors have reached? Wouldn't it be more correct to admit that the resurrected will achieve their transformation with the help of their resurrectors easily and quickly, even if the resurrected were Nero, Attila, or some cannibal? 134

I must say that Fedorov did not count on any scientific inventions in the matter of resurrection; On page 287 of the first volume of “Philos. of the Common Cause” it is said: “We must not think that we hope for the discovery of some force specially designated for the restoration of life; we believe that the conversion of the blind force of nature into a conscious one is this means.” In the same way, Fedorov did not dare and did not intend to bring Christ down from heaven through the efforts of science[7], since he believed in the promise of the Savior that He would be with those gathered in His Name, and, according to Fedorov, for the work of the resurrection, for the work of Christ, Who said of Himself - “I am the resurrection and the life”135 - it is necessary to gather the entire human race.

And how is it possible to attribute to Fedorov that in the work of the resurrection he counts only on the unilateral action of man without the participation of Divine grace, when - according to his thought - by carrying out the work of the resurrection, the human race fulfills only the will of God and is only an instrument of God in this work. And why is the idea absurd and blasphemous that resurrection can and must be achieved by natural forces, by natural means, for all these forces and means are God's creation, destined for perfection. Perfection cannot be created; every creation, every work, as a creature, i.e. something dependent, by this very fact cannot be perfection; but the Lord, having created the world, nature, put into his creation everything necessary for the attainment of perfection; and from it, from this world, like Eve from Adam's rib, God created a being gifted with reason, i.e. the ability to know what God created, and, having known, to take control of natural forces; the Lord created this being as his instrument for acting through it on the world, on the natural forces of nature. Knowledge is science, which will not be an empty, useless occupation only when it sets as its goal the introduction of reason and life into blind and dead nature. At the present time, science, in its present direction, when its paths diverge from the paths of Christ and the Galilean fishermen, as you admit in the 7th chapter of your book about Soloviev, which you speak of Fedorov's influence on him, is, of course, a game not worth the candle. For resurrection, as Soloviev understands it, a complete and radical change is required, according to you (p. 420 of your answer to me), not only of the laws of life, but also of the very laws of matter, and this is possible only for the creative power of the Deity. "A resurrected creature, from this point of view, is in the full sense of the word a new creature," you say. Shouldn't we conclude from this that, according to Soloviev, God did not create what was needed, and therefore everything created must perish? Although some kind of resurrection is spoken of, but what kind of resurrection is this, if what is resurrected is in the full sense of the word a new creature? Is this so? According to Fedorov, the general resurrection is a complete transformation of the universe, but by the forces of the same matter that was created by God. In its embryonic state, such a transformation is contained in the world even now, although at the present time, due to the blindness of natural forces, life is trampled underfoot by life; when these forces begin to see clearly (the insight has already begun in man, who is the same nature, but possessing consciousness, the ability to look back, to look at himself), then these same forces will transform the world, and the forces of matter will no longer be deadly, but life-giving. And why is the thought of Soloviev, who accuses God of unsuccessful creation, expects or even demands from him a new creative act and thereby removes man from any serious activity, condemning him to vanity alone - why is this thought broader than the thought of Fedorov, who does not bring any accusation against God and, recognizing man as an instrument of the Divine will, opens up before man a limitless field of activity? Then you point out the difference in the views of Solovyov and Fedorov on sin, contrary to the opinion I expressed that Solovyov was, one must think, as I put it, in agreement with Fedorov, who asserts that ignorance is the greatest mortal sin, and not with Prince Trubetskoy, who believes that "from the Christian point of view, death is the consequence of sin, and not of ignorance." <…>

It must be said, however, that, recognizing ignorance as a mortal sin, Fedorov placed his hope not in theoretical, inactive knowledge, which Fedorov also considered to be entirely compatible with the concept of the evil spirit. Only theoretical knowledge, not applied to action, to life, gives nothing, saves from nothing, and does not hold back; with such knowledge people are forced to do not the good that they want, but often the evil that they hate, as was said by the Apostle Paul136. According to Fedorov, knowledge is projective: any knowledge is only a project that must be realized. Thus, astronomical knowledge, astronomical research is nothing more than reconnaissance into other worlds, which must become the field of activity of the human race; man must acquire and will undoubtedly acquire the ability to visit and populate all the worlds of the universe. Linguistics are attempts to create a common language necessary for a common cause, [ — a language] that must be based on the forgotten roots of the ancestral language. According to Fedorov, everyone who does must also be a researcher of the cause in which he participates, must be a researcher and a teacher, introducing the younger generation to his cause. In his opinion, all institutions—judicial, administrative, governmental, and public—should form themselves into learned societies that study, from archival documents, their past lives in order to establish the causes of those life phenomena that gave rise to the need for a given institution, in order to, by acting on the causes of phenomena, give life the proper direction, in order to, by acting on the causes of the emergence of, for example, crimes—the number of which is growing immeasurably and is stifling our courts—reduce and then completely eliminate them. According to Fedorov, teachers of all educational institutions, not only higher and secondary, but also lower ones, should be researchers of the locality where the educational institution is located—in all respects, and introduce students into these studies, i.e.—in the case of universal compulsory education—all those born and living, without any exceptions. Everything obtained by such research, experiments and observations, meteorological, seismic, astronomical and all other, must ascend from the lower educational institutions to the middle, from the middle to the higher and from the higher, finally, to one central institution, the Academy, the conclusions of which from all the observations thus obtained must descend back to all the higher, middle and lower educational institutions, which must all be in constant interrelation. In the end, all institutions will form one and universal compulsory education will merge with universal compulsory service for the defense of the fatherland, i.e. with military service, which from a weapon of struggle with one's own kind will turn into a weapon of struggle with the blind forces of nature, with hunger, disease and, finally, death itself. The entire human race will be transformed, in this way, into a union of fathers and mothers for the upbringing and education of sons and daughters, into a union of fathers and mothers raising and educating sons and daughters as one son (by son is meant also daughter), the only begotten son, bearing in himself the image of the Father. "Such is the original meaning of "education", now arbitrarily understood and applied in the matter of enlightenment," says Fedorov on page 78 of the first volume of "Philosophy of the Common Cause".

With such an organization of knowledge, science, i.e. the human mind, now in disarray, with such an organization, embracing the entire human race and directed to the implementation of the work of Christ, the resurrection, with the participation, therefore, of Christ Himself, Our God, according to His promise, at first invisible, and then clearly felt, will there be anything impossible, unattainable for this mind, which, according to you, acts only where it can! And is it possible that the Spirit of God, Who “blows where He wishes” 137, will not want to inspire this mind and make it omnipotent? And is it possible that this thought, set forth here of necessity too briefly, a thought that is revealed to man, not to each one individually, but to the union of people, gradually expanding to the entire human race, is less broad than the thought of Soloviev, according to which man is deprived of any opportunity to act and must remain only in anticipation of whether he will be honored with Divine grace, and how to achieve this honor is unknown, and, in all likelihood, no achievement is possible, contrary to the words of the Lord Himself that the Kingdom of God is forced, taken by force, because grace is supposedly given by election (“The Spirit blows where it wishes”), and not by merit, not by work. According to Fedorov, true knowledge requires that research be carried out by everyone, always and everywhere, and that experiments should not be limited to laboratories and physics rooms, and the application of what these institutions have obtained should not be limited to application only to factory and plant production; according to his idea, the most necessary and most useful participants in scientific research and observations will be peasant farmers; and only through peasant farmers will the highest and broadest scientific conclusions find their application, which currently have no application, not because they are not applicable, but only because our present life is too narrow; for our present, current life, some literacy and four rules of arithmetic are completely sufficient; and this is necessary only for city dwellers, while peasant farmers, until they become observers and researchers of the business in which they are engaged, do not need either literacy or arithmetic, therefore, those who complete the course of rural schools soon become illiterate again. From your words that “the highest knowledge that controls the elements—to the extent that such control is possible—is inevitably the business of the intellectual aristocracy” (p. 424 of the Answer to Me), I concluded that you are not at all familiar with Fedorov, otherwise you would not have said this and would have admitted that the teaching about the resurrection is the most democratic, excluding everything aristocratic. In one letter, which will be published in the 3rd volume, Fedorov, among other things, says: “I am extremely surprised why this very democratic teaching, which replaces immortality, supposedly belonging to man by right of birth, with immortality acquired through labor, labor that is not egoistic, labor that is common, collective, brotherly, labor not for oneself, but for parents, ancestors, those very ones whom the people with their lamentations try to call from the graves, replaces it with work on dust, decay, instead of pure work on one’s soul, on thoughts, instead of exclusive concern for the salvation of one’s soul, why this teaching, which never separates itself from others, which wants to work for everyone and with everyone, that is, with all the living, for all the dead, why this teaching is recognized by the aristocrats themselves, not the young, but the old, with pride, and especially philosophers and scientists. The latter are already selflessly ready to sacrifice their future life, in which they do not believe, for the good of posterity"138.

After all that has been said, I consider myself entitled to disagree with you and to assert that the confession made by Solovyov in his first letter to Fedorov, in which Solovyov says that the goal of Fedorov's project is "to save all of humanity by common cause" and that this project "is the first movement of the human spirit along the path of Christ" - these words were not at all an exaggeration and the result of a hasty, superficial acquaintance with Fedorov's work, as you say, but a sincere recognition of the greatness of what Solovyov had become acquainted with. The very title of the project read and the very recognition of the goal of this project in "to save all of humanity by common cause" testify that, having read the notebook given to him, Solovyov understood it properly. Unfortunately, Solovyov had the ability, having succumbed to the sincere attraction of the mind and heart, to then move into moods of a different sort under the influence of considerations of a “public nature,” as he expressed it in one letter to N. F. Fedorov (before an essay on the medieval worldview), and also, probably, under the influence of considerations of a personal nature, personal pride, etc. Such transitions in relations with Fedorov were not the only time that Solovyov fulfilled his promise to come to Kerensk, not because he did not get to Tsertelev in Lipyagi139, but simply because after he had given his promise, the thought occurred to him that such a visit would not be too much of a courtesy on his part.

I do not dare to ask you to print this letter yourself, but I consider it my duty to warn you that it will be published. I cannot, and must not, leave your answer without objection.

Dear Sir
Nikolai Pavlovich

I am very grateful to you for your lengthy letter. Of course, I can only welcome any attempts to illuminate in the press the relations between Fedorov and Soloviev, although, of course, any interpretations of these relations that cast a shadow on the character of the late V.S. will meet with the most decisive protest on my part.

I cannot agree with you for many reasons, which I cannot write about, since this would require too lengthy an exposition. I will only say in passing that the ideal of the "new creation" that you reject belongs not to me, but to the Apostle Paul (Galatians 6:15), that this same Apostle decisively rejects Fedorov's idea of ​​the resurrection of people in the same form in which they died (1 Cor. 15:42, 43) and especially Cor. 15:51 et seq. - about the general change at the resurrection. The most important thing is that the true resurrection is the perfect union of God with man, the consequence of which is the abolition of death. How it is accomplished, infants know (mystically, not scientifically) infinitely better than the "wise and prudent."

In view of the decisive necessity of making a choice between Fedorov and the Gospel, I, of course, without a moment's hesitation, choose the latter.

Sincerely respecting you
Prince E. Trubetskoy.

I will be very glad if you find it possible to interpret Soloviev's relationship with Fedorov so that it does not cast a shadow on the character of V<ladimir> S<ergeevich>ch, and in this case you will not encounter any objections from me. Regarding the necessity of choosing between Fedorov and the Gospel, I will repeat again: only because you do not know Fedorov do you think that this choice must be made. I myself came to Christ and the Gospel from unbelief through Fedorov, and I think that our intelligentsia, almost entirely unbelieving, will come to faith only through Fedorov. “True resurrection is the perfect Union of God with man, the consequence of which is the abolition of death,” you say; But union, and not merging, with God is Fedorov’s idea, who sees the basis of the doctrine of the Trinity in the prayer of Our Lord Jesus Christ: “That they may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, so they (the world, the human race) may be one in Us.” As for the Apostle Paul, Paul, despite the height and depth of his writings, he also has “one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, another glory of the stars, but even a star differs from a star”142 - does this not mean transferring to heaven that which separates us here on earth, arouses in us envy for each other, and envy gives birth to hatred and all the horrors of human life. And how is it possible to shine with different glory when united with God [8]. As for the texts from the Apostle Paul that you cited, not one of them contradicts the teaching on the resurrection, and the expression “new creation” is not used at all in the sense of a new creative act. And if infants know infinitely better than the wise and intelligent how the resurrection will be accomplished, i.e. the most important and main thing, then why do we need science, professors, universities, why do we need coverage in the press of the relationship between Fedorov and Solovyov. According to Fedorov, this will be known by those who, having reached adulthood, i.e. having developed their minds, will preserve childish, infantile purity; only the reasonable and wise, and at the same time pure, will come to the mind of truth and will be one with God144.

<…> Add, when you answer (but please, in a decent, and not that delicate handwriting, as you used to have) - whether you have health and a happy mood of spirit and a desire to meet again with me, who always loved you. Is your mother alive, mine - died. I, already old, and probably also close to death, feel like an orphan and somehow small. That's what mothers mean. But you still took care of yours, and I ... I don't want to remember. <…>

Is it possible to instruct a store to send me materials about Nikolai Fyodorovich to “Dym Otechestva” (Smoke of the Fatherland), with payment on the parcel?

Your Excellency,
Dear Sir
Nikolai Pavlovich!

The money has been transferred by me to cover the cost of the two books you sent me. Knowing what expenses you have to make on publishing books, I consider it even dishonest for myself not to pay such a small sum of money.

I have read the entire second volume of N. F. Fedorov’s works. It is easy to read after the first volume. Even the appearance of the edition of this volume helps a lot. You recommended paying attention to the articles on art and the Museum147. How lofty, truthful and vital is the theory of art by N. F. Fedorov! How far from it and insignificant are both the theory of “art for art’s sake” and various theories of utilitarian art. There the goals of art are either aimless amusement or service to whim and even lust. N. F., however, gives art the great purpose of being a sacred act of restoring everything affected by decay and death to incorruptible, immortal and godly beauty. Here is both the greatness of the task and the wealth of means for its fulfillment. And only with this supreme goal of art is agreement possible between it and religion, since any other beauty and service to it is considered by religion to be a delusion and a fall. This same thing elevates art to complete agreement and equality with abstract science, since here art is the complete and perfect realization of both the ideas of “pure thinking” (according to Kant) and the conclusions of exact knowledge. Under the impression of N. F.'s article on art, I recalled some passages in the Holy Scriptures that relate to art, and I was surprised by N. F.'s complete infallibility against the Word of God. For example, in the book of the Wisdom of Solomon, Chapter 14, Verse 15, the beginning of pagan art is indicated: "A father, tormented by bitter grief over his early deceased son, made an image of him, as of an already dead man, then began to honor him as God, and passed on to his subjects the secrets and sacrifices." And this creation of dead likenesses became the lot of pagan art, for which it suffered heavy condemnation and a curse in the Word of God. But here is the beginning of true art: "And they shall build me a sanctuary, and I will dwell among them. All (make), as I show you, and the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its vessels; so do you" (Exodus Chapter 25, Verses 8-9). Here is the difference between true art and false: “Blessed is the tree through which righteousness comes! But this thing made with hands is cursed, both itself and he who made it!” (Wisdom of Solomon 14:7 and 8). Here is the attitude of Christianity to Old Testament art: “It (the tabernacle) is a figure for the present time, in which gifts and sacrifices are offered, which cannot make him who offers perfect in conscience” (Hebrews 9:9). “But Christ, being come an high priest of the good things to come, by the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this construction… entered once into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption” (Ibid. 11-12). I understand this as an indication that in the Old Testament there was no perfect ideal for art, but now there is one in the person of Christ. The whole weight of the condemnation of pagan art by the word of God lies in pointing out the deadness of its creations and attributing to them non-existent qualities and actions and, moreover, a character contrary to God-pleasing morality. Consequently, true art must create living likenesses of the most perfect ideal of the Son of Man, given to us in the God-man Jesus Christ. Finally, even to confirm that the common and final goal of all forms of art is the restoration of dead generations, there are clear and precise instructions in the Holy Scripture: “Prophesy to these bones, and say to them: “Dry bones! Hear the word of the Lord.” Thus says the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and ye shall live. I prophesied as I was commanded… and the spirit entered into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, a very, very great army…”148 The entire 37th chapter of the Book of the Prophet Ezekiel speaks of this. It is noteworthy that God entrusts the matter of reviving dead bones to man. And here are the Words of the Lord Jesus Christ: “Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live” (John 5:25). We can even assume that this will happen through people living on earth, for these are the words of our Lord: “I am with you even to the end of the age”; “where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them”149.

In the article "On the Museum" N. F. aims to embody the conclusions of his teaching in concrete forms, demonstrating both the practical feasibility and even the logical necessity of this feasibility, without which all value of the teaching itself is lost. And with what conviction he does this! His reasoning about universal military service: about its role for meteoric regulation and the implantation of peace in the world150, I think, can be the best apology for military affairs, and what benefit they would bring to society in freeing it from the hypnosis of nightmarish teachings and "non-resistance to evil", and Nietzschean self-will, and the insolence of "supermen" at everything, and the delusions of socialism. In Sarai there were people interested in the philosophy of N. F. The commander of the department, Lieutenant Colonel T. I. Melnikov (he knows you from Ashkhabad) is reading the first volume, and the doctor N. M. Yemelyanov is reading the second. I have not yet received any opinions. I have received rain gauges, but there is nothing to observe until late autumn, since there has been no rain or precipitation other than dew all summer. The thermometers are still being calibrated at the Observatory. Classes at school, mainly because of the intense heat, have been suspended until September. Regarding Fr. Archpriest M. V. Kolobov151, I have no precise information after leaving Ashgabat. Having seen the New Bishop off from Ashgabat, he said that he was pleased with his attitude towards him. And then rumors reached me that an investigation had been ordered against Fr. Archpriest and that he was being transferred from Ashgabat to Baku.

Please do not refuse me my most respectful request to send me a copy of the book upon publication of the 3rd volume of N. F. Fedorov's works.

With the utmost respect and deep devotion, I have the honor of being Your Excellency's humble servant and humble pilgrim

<…> Now a few words about Nikolai Fed-ch, although the too abundant, of necessity, disputes about him with Peterson, about his polemics with Trubetskoi152, have somewhat become a pain in my ass in this regard, so that I will limit myself now to only a few comments, preferring to postpone a more detailed conversation until a personal meeting. In any case, I am very glad that you have formulated your attitude toward N. F-ch’s teaching definitely and decisively. True, you are expecting explanations, and from me! I am afraid that I will not undertake the difficult task of giving them for publication, and even if I did undertake this, I am almost certain that what would be presented as explanations would not lessen your negative attitude, but rather strengthen it. The fact is that it is hardly possible to make a satisfactory equation between the personal religiosity and the Orthodoxy of N. F-ch, which for one who knew him directly are an indisputable fact, and the degree of religiosity and Orthodoxy of his doctrine, for the impeccability of which in this regard I cannot vouch, although it sincerely seemed to the old man that his teaching was absolutely religious and purely Orthodox. The overestimation of the natural means of salvation of mankind (by mankind itself) and the underestimation of the significance of the means of grace in the teaching of N. F-ch are obvious to me, not only in what has been published, but also in what has not been published and in what has not been written, as well as in what has been revealed in conversations with him. He himself was not aware of the minimum of Grace with which he made do and what he reduced this minimum to. But precisely because he was not aware of this and did not see the dangers arising from it, he limited himself in what he wrote to what was, and did not raise further questions about the relationship of his pan-human work to the divine work. If we admit that everything essential, characteristic of N. F-ch, has already been expressed by him, then this teaching is unacceptable not only for you, but also for me, and will prove to be in irreconcilable contradiction with the teaching of the Church. Peterson has the tactlessness and self-will to insist that N. F-ch has supposedly said everything that he could say, and that this is a kind of divine revelation, and he recognizes N. F-ch's writings as divinely inspired in this sense. Peterson expressed this confidence that everything essential has already been expressed by N. F-ch and that everything expressed is clear and impeccable in his correspondence with Trubetskoy. And then Trubetskoy put a dilemma to him: “In that case, one has to choose between the Gospel and Fedorov, and I (Ev. N. T<rubetskoy>), without hesitation, choose the Gospel!”153 I barely restrained Peterson from new polemical attacks that would have spread this cruel alternative to general knowledge (through Novoye Vremya). But I restrained him not only for tactical reasons, but especially because I, who knew N. F-ch no less than Peterson, am far from convinced that what N. F-ch has printed and written contains everything that can be deduced from his main ideas. I am convinced that if the dangers that have already become apparent had been revealed during N. F-ch's lifetime, he, with his characteristic caution towards himself, would have again begun to examine himself, would have recognized the inadequacy of the participation of Grace expressed (in what he wrote), and perhaps would have significantly softened the rationalistic-materialistic tendency of his teaching and would have thought better of his aversion to the mystical element. I have reason to think this because he has repeatedly expressed verbally and in letters that he "fears nothing so much as that the 'advanced' and unbelievers will 'grant' him the title of atheist, an honor which he flatly refuses." And so, in order to prevent this danger of “distorting it” (“the crudest,” as he expressed it), he entrusted the manuscripts to me, always looking at them as unfinished and imperfect and saying that he was afraid not only of the atheistic zeal of such people who would lead him into atheism, but also of the apologetic zeal of Peterson, whom he considered dangerous precisely because of his rash decisiveness in defense, which was now (in the incident with Trubetskoy) brilliantly confirmed.

I do not know whether these lines shed anything new on you regarding N. F-ch and his own attitude to his teaching. I will add only the following: in my opinion, the entire fate of N. F-ch’s teaching lies in clarifying the misunderstanding touched upon here. There is a danger of interpreting his teaching in a rationalistic and materialistic sense only; this danger is great and to a large extent, it is thoroughly motivated, if we limit ourselves to what was written by N. F-ch. It is not easy to prove the possibility of reworking the teaching with a strong bias towards religion (raising the importance of the blessed means of the common human cause), and for people who did not personally know the old man, it is hardly possible. That is why there is a good chance that if attention to this teaching grows, signs of which are available, it will be interpreted more and more rationalistically and materialistically, until God's participation in the arrangement of the salvation of the world is completely thrown out of it, as an unnecessary (organic) appendage. This will be, from the point of view of N. F-ch, a "gross distortion", but the reason for which is given to him (as he himself told me). Sventsitsky and Brekhnichev, with their enthusiasm for the ideas of N. F-ch, are, perhaps, unconsciously, a transition to such a distortion. Sergei Nik<olaevich>154 also fully admits the future “use” of N. F-ch’s teaching by non-believers in the above-mentioned sense. On the other hand, in letters and personal conversations, I meet quite a few people who are convinced of the profound religiousness of N. F-ch’s ideas and value them precisely from this side and admit that resurrection according to his teaching cannot be understood as being realized only materially, only materialistically. These are the difficulties that arise and grow with each passing day! At first, I expected complete indifference to N. F-ch and even ridicule as madness. In this, I was obviously mistaken. Among the “patented” philosophers, he is doomed in advance to neglect, for he does not at all meet the requirements imposed on the type of philosopher created according to school rules. But among the philosophizing commoners and plebeians, interest in him is revealed, not to mention individual, although not many, genuine philosophical minds that do not limit Sophia to routine school frameworks. I did not touch on your main prejudice against the "Old Man" - his "invasion of the sanctuary of Death" ... I would like to talk to you about this face to face someday. Here is a clash with "Fedorovianism" more fundamental than any other, and on this point I thirst for clarification from you. <…>

<…> On September 14, the celebration of the 1600th anniversary of the Edict of Milan took place; had to prepare a speech to deliver at the school, and the spirit of N. F. F., insofar as they managed to penetrate the presentation, lifted both the speaker and the listeners into a new world of concepts about people, life and goals…

As for your article155, I can now report the following: it was read three times in three places, twice with adults, once with realist students; the article caused a lively exchange of opinions, especially among the students' (library) circle, which decided to make N. F. F. their patron and protector and to read his works for an hour or two a week after classes…

This evening the article will be read in another house with an addition from Mikhail Nikolaevich156, sent by you, for which I am very grateful. It has not yet been possible to publish the article: I will begin to bother with all measures in this direction through the teachers of the Theological Seminary; It is only a pity that one of them, who was more interested than the others, who took both volumes from me for the summer, who promised to read an essay at the Seminary, was transferred in August to Vyatka... (Lavrov); there is still one left - a teacher of logic and philosophy... I confess that I have not yet transferred the copies (three) to the libraries of the Teachers' Seminary and the Theological Seminary: they are still in the hands of readers; I am afraid that from the director's hands they will not go further than the shelves due to the ignorance of the teachers, but now they are still being read[9]; I will ask you and Vl. Al. Kozhevnikov for a period of about a month, until N. F.'s books are sufficiently known among the teachers of these institutions, to which endeavors are being made... In the near future, by mail, I must send you 5 voluminous letters with harsh criticism of N. F. F. from one of the local readers, who sometimes writes in magazines (of a legal nature). He expressed the desire that his criticism be read to other readers of N. F. F., including students (circle); as soon as this is done, I will forward the letters to you... I think that the result of the reading will be somewhat different from what the author assumes... <…>

LIFE'S CALL.
Found:
The meaning and purpose of life
By a brilliant man, philosopher Nikolai Fyodorovich
Fedorov,
and his co-workers, Great people, V.A.K. and N.P.P.158,
in his work Philosophy of the Common Cause, volume 1

This is God speaking through the mouth of Nikolai Fyodorovich, to reveal and enlighten all mankind about the meaning and purpose of life. At least I found it in his work, Philosophy of the Common Cause, volume 1. And I searched for 30 years, searched for it everywhere, I began to search with scientists, starting with Socrates and other similar philosophers, who said and taught: know yourself and go nowhere, and I finished my searches by Lev Nikolaevich Tolstoy. He taught and told us to simplify, to be spiritually reborn and not to do; I took the latter, not to do, not to think about life, not to believe in anything or anyone. Neither in God, nor in the Christian religion, nor in learned people, nor in science, nor in people, nor in the church, nor in the clergy, and I almost did not believe in myself, and I got to the point, no body, no soul - the mind is like a wrinkled apple in the sun, in which there is no juice, no freshness, only dry wrinkles are seen in it, and so I lived in such a position, my dear brother, without soul and body, and only thought, for what and for what all this is, they are born, live, grow old, get sick and the end of everything is death, according to the teachings of Nietzsche, I think he said: dies and is born again, this is some kind of hopeless wheel, one meaningless thing comes out. Of course, my dear brother, I am not the only one in the world who has probably resembled a wrinkled apple, there are probably others who are like a wrinkled apple without a body and soul, and they also repeat it.

What is all this for and what is it all for, of course, this is a tormenting question, what is it for and what is it for and where was the outcome and meaning, in what - in health? This is also temporary, today healthy, tomorrow sick; in work too - today worked, tomorrow sick, the work remained; in science too - studied, lived, then died; in money too, there is none, in luxury too. There is no life, no meaning, all this is hindered by illness, old age and death, everything of ours remains for others and it turns out that way, nothing but the turning of a wheel, the same and again and again great for the question, what is it for and what is it for. Of course, my dear brother, then there would be a point if a person did not get sick, did not grow old and did not die, of course, every person would agree not to get sick, not to grow old and not to die; then therefore we need to do something, at first, in order not to get sick, not to grow old, not to die and to have a meaning and purpose in life, we all need to unite and listen, study the teachings of the brilliant philosopher, the man Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov, in his work Philosophy of the Common Cause, in the 1st volume. The only thing is that we will find an answer to our question, for what and for what <…> when humanity unites and finishes this question, then we will say: all this is necessary for the life of all humanity, then everywhere and in everything we will have a meaning and purpose in life. Firstly, we will not get sick, we will not get sick, secondly, we will not grow old and die either, evil death will not be terrible for us, it will go into eternal history, and since there is no death, and the meaning and purpose of life is, and will be!

I am now, my dear brother, I was reborn in soul and body only after reading N.F. Fedorov, a miracle happened to me. The wrinkles on my body were gone, they were smoothed out, I received freshness of soul, mind and body, I was completely revived, and I turned back to my past life and looked: I was like a predatory beast - give me everything for free, and I did nothing except destroy natural resources, and I could not create anything, I took inaction as the motto of L.N. Tolstoy's existence; how sad and painful and erroneous my life was, and now I look to the future with a healthy body and soul and in everything I find the meaning and purpose of life. We all need to have work, not free, by nature blind, the past was all my mistake about the meaning and purpose of life, I do not blame myself and others, my dear brother, it was a World mistake - from great to small people of course. The leaders and teachers had only one words, and even then without beginning or end, and they pointed out and taught, each in his own way, for his party, but not for all people, Lev Nikolaevich Tolstoy had a party of Tolstoyans, and Nietzsche had Nietzscheans, and Marx had Marxists, and so on, and in this party spirit there is nothing but evil, hostility and destruction, there is nothing vital and nothing to be seen, only death is visible, as it destroys party after party for their disunity, and everything was done according to their childish age and understanding. Of course, my dear brother, if we are to be healthy and alive, then for this we must be adults, not party affiliation, [but] we must teach and preach one goal of life, to be healthy, common work on our nurse, the earth, the struggle [with] the blind force of nature, for our daily bread, one for all, and all for one.

Yes, it is time for us to become adults and learn the meaning and purpose of life, and for this we all need knowledge; so that knowledge would be accessible to everyone and everywhere like air, then every human being will have its purpose on our nurse, the earth, and everyone will find something to do, to each his own, what everyone will be capable of, and all of humanity will unite its abilities and declare a protest against blind nature, against crop failures, famines, diseases, old age and death, from which all the evil comes to us on earth, which we do not know how to manage at all in our infancy. [To] be an adult, you need to know the meaning and purpose of life, and [when] all of humanity learns the meaning and purpose of life, then each person will apply their knowledge to the matter and will be perfect, like our Heavenly Father, then each person will not be a burden to another person, but we will be a joy to each other, and everyone will have their own assigned work - different things, but the goal and meaning of life is one for everyone: the struggle for life ь eternal.

But no one will be aware of the struggle for existence, to live and fight among ourselves - this is our childhood, and for eternal life - this will be the business of adults, age is knowledge, and if there is knowledge, then the Divine mind exists in us, through the Divine mind we will know everything and unite with God, become an instrument of his holy will and become a man-god, and when all humanity unites in the man-god, then all humanity will work miracles, with their labor and knowledge and the will of God, who does not wish death to childhood. And there is no sense: the Heavenly Father lives forever, and we children die. Until we are perfect, like our Heavenly Father, we will continue to die, but when we are perfect, like our Heavenly Father, then we will be freed from this death, and since there is no death, then there will be eternal life, no evil, no suffering, no old age, and then we will create through reason and by our own will everything that exists and is on our nurse the earth, everything that is needed for eternal life for all mankind. Then new people will be created, immortal, what death took, mankind will restore again with its labor and reason; the earth and the sky will be one whole, everyone will have a place and work, no one will interfere with anyone, there are many lands in space, just populate and rule and create; what kind of life, I think, will be, only joys, without end, and from this kingdom of life we, in our childish understanding, have moved very far and are leaving with great labor and earthly suffering and are all going along the wrong path. Of course, my dear brother, and we see and feel on ourselves all the weight of the earth, let us try to return to that true path, which we considered false, and Christ calls us to this day: come, all suffering humanity, I will calm you and deliver you from all your troubles and sufferings and death! Let us follow, my dear brother, Christ the redeemer of the human race. He came and proclaimed to humanity the true path, humanity did not follow him because of its own understanding, and those who did, and then for the sake of personal benefit, like Catholics and their indulgences. And why, my dear brother, not to believe and follow Christ, you and I followed others and believed them, although again, from Socrates to Tolstoy Lev Nikolaevich, we got one error, in the form of a wrinkled apple, we had neither soul nor body left, it was a great mistake of all of us people, but now let us believe with all our reason in Christ and resort to the protection of the Christian faith. Faith and Science will lead all of humanity to the path that Christ showed us; and the Brilliant Philosopher Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov explained the path of Christ to us in his work, the Philosophy of the Common Cause, the path to eternal life for all of humanity. And the universal Church will serve as a beacon for us, this beacon is non-partisan, non-class, but of all of humanity, there will be one flock and one shepherd.

God is the father of all people, the goal of Christianity is such that everyone unites <…> all of humanity and would constitute one whole, and in all of humanity there is the power of the Divine, and in discord alone we have only a part of the Divine, one in the field is not a warrior! The Church tells us to pray with the World, and not separately, and the Christian faith and the Church calls everyone to pray and work on blind nature, from which all of humanity suffers, which the great Genius N.F. Fyodorov explained and showed us, he showed us simply and logically what to do at first and what we should pray for and what we should wish for to all mankind. Of course, all people will have the desire to work and fight for their lives and health, and not for existence; we only exist now, but do not live, and when we live, only then will our life be immortal.

Of course, my dear brother, the Christian religion and the church are accessible to everyone and call everyone to the path and life that Christ proclaimed to us, only we all need to delve into the meaning of the Christian Faith and its dogmas, and we will receive the meaning of life, also from the scientific side <…> and there will also be a meaning to life. And if you take these two things together, delve into the Christian Faith and science, then you will get not only meaning, but Genius. There cannot be a body without blood, just as science cannot live without Faith and faith cannot live without science, science and faith are the whole, all of humanity, and all of rational humanity is eternal life. Now we have a small misunderstanding: Faith and science go separately, faith is accessible to all, believers and non-believers, and science only to the chosen ones. But it must be done this way: just as Faith is accessible to all, so science must be accessible to all, like air. <…> Combine science and Christian faith into one whole or together - and then there will be no fragmentation either in science or in religion, but an eternal path will result. <…> Faith and science and humanity will all be united by union in the Holy Trinity, inseparable, for eternal life and for deeds of joy; and we will all get rid of unbearable and hateful deeds, and the Kingdom of Peace of all humanity will come, there will be no place for malice or enmity then.

And now humanity has only inaction, if they do, then they do things for tomorrow, in order to spend it like children. The more rubles you squander, the more entertaining it will be for a child. But will I have to spend that day for which I had saved a ruble for trinkets? - no one is insured against death, fell ill and died, and everything that I acquired remains: where is the meaning and purpose of life here? It is not by little things that one should live, my dear brother, but by work, and there is a lot of work on our breadwinner, the land, the working season has come, we have taken everything for free that could be taken, now we must declare ourselves in everything for life, for every year and day. There are no forests, there is nothing left to make a hut out of, and there are no bricks either, there is no forest, there is nothing to burn and nothing to heat the stoves with, there is no firewood, no straw, it did not become born for free. Death comes to us from all sides, it presses on us, and we are still amusing ourselves with our little things, we are even afraid to think, to fight back. There are people who work according to their age, only alone, and very few of them, and it would not hurt for adults to unite with young people, for the working season, and it is time for the city to come to the province, to the village and the countryside, for the working season. And the city and the village will not be able to work with nature alone, but together everything is possible and accessible! During the harvest, our whole family works, both old and young: some mow, some tie a sheaf, children drag bridles and trusses, some drag a sheaf, look - and a shock of grain appeared, but one cannot do all this, and everything can disappear, or it can rot, then hunger and death to the individual. And our whole breadwinner, the earth, is the common field of all mankind, here both the learned and the uneducated, and the common man, and the intelligent, both the city and the village must work, then a whole family of all mankind will be formed. Whoever is capable of what and whoever is able to do what, he must work for the life of all mankind, one for all, and all for one, then our daily bread will be given, for our common labor, the bread of life will be, we will be well-fed and alive, we will not die from it, but we will give life to each other; moreover, we will give life to those whom death took, through our ignorance, and we will restore, resurrect to the last man, in the rights of eternal life, which also gave us life, albeit temporary, and then there will be a common eternal life for all mankind.

Although take food matters, crop failures and famines, which have become very common on our nurse the earth. And what do we do, dear brother? Only canteen feedings, for the sake of popularity: such and such a person feeds starving people there, where they eat quinoa. This is all childish. You tell me, what should we do, except for canteens, we are powerless against crop failures and famines and droughts. I am a very small person in my understanding, and even then I can point out one thing during droughts: to maintain moisture in the fields with grain, for this we have hollows and ravines, which need to be scientifically dammed, dammed, and then during the winter and during floods they will be full of water, and water gives moisture, and there will be moisture - and there will be plants. And where there are no hollows and ravines and snow, there we need to conduct water from rivers and waterfalls for the same purpose, and there other measures need to be taken, of which there can be many, and not to deal with canteens, from which there is neither light nor joy. Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov has many measures that can be applied to crop failures and droughts in his work “The Philosophy of the Common Cause,” volume 1. The article “The Food Question”159, with all the details that can be applied to hunger and death, says simply and clearly what we should do with crop failures and droughts. Of course, the time is not far off when in no country will there be bread, it will not grow, then there will be nothing to buy or sell, and we will inevitably leave canteens and intermediaries from and profit, and then all of humanity will find itself in equal dignity in <in>human hunger. Of course, it will be unreasonable for us to bring this to all of humanity, although we are childishly accustomed to everything free: what God and the earth give is ours, and we ourselves do nothing for this, neither God nor the earth. And humanity has become adults, and not children; everything is forgivable to children, but adult humanity cannot be forgiven for its all the blunders of life. Nature in her blindness constantly makes herself known to us and punishes us, now with this, now with that, now with hunger, now with pestilence, not to mention old age and death, as if nothing could be done against the blind force of nature. It has now become untrue that nothing can be done - all that is needed is for all mankind to unite and set about regulating the nature of blind force; and to stop making all sorts of trinkets and amusing themselves with them, and each person should use all his or her activities to study blind nature and present it with his or her struggle for his or her life.

We, all mankind, have the first and most powerful tool or weapon, Divine reason, which was given to us by a rational God as a defense against the blind force of nature, and we have turned Divine reason to what? - to city trinkets and baubles to please women, to their childish attire and amusements. It’s like Christmastide, everyone goes out in their best clothes every day, everyone wears what they can and everyone out-rides whom, and it’s gotten to the point that everyone is overtired, sick, nervous, and then we say: life is hard, there’s nothing to live on and it’s cramped, there’s no life, only hopelessness, then we want to kill ourselves tsiat. We ourselves are all guilty of our childish misunderstanding before our Divine mind, it calls us into the expanse of work and labor, where everyone will have enough work forever and everywhere on earth and in heaven. To live on our nurse earth and say: "there is nothing to live on, nothing to do" - this is one of our childish delusions. Of course, there is nothing to live on and nothing to do - it is in cities and factories that life is very narrow and even closed, all people cannot live in cities and factories and plants, all of humanity cannot and cannot be able to do, and everyone cannot find work there for themselves. But the entire intelligentsia and cities need to look into the villages and hamlets, and to the farmsteads, where there is breadth and space, and untouched corners of work lie, waiting for Divine Reason, which will come, will sort out each matter piece by piece - what needs to be done and what does not need to be done, what is useful for the life of humanity, what is harmful and not useful for humanity. There must be a fight with blind nature in food and sanitary and other matters, because here sanitary matters help people in the cities very little, and then with difficulty in half. And as for the villages and hamlets, a very sad thing: one doctor for the entire volost and the patient travels ten miles, but the doctor should be with the patient, and not the patient with the doctor. Sanitary matters must go hand in hand with faith and the church, where the church is - and there must be a school of medicine, and doctors, access to the school must be the same as to the church, only then will medicine begin to act correctly and enter the fight against all diseases and old age and death, which frightens us very much, but in fact is not so terrible, and even now they are fighting and curing something. Although death destroys the human organism, but not completely, but only cleanses it, helps science to collect it in its pure form and restore it again, dry mummies, clean and dry bones lie for millennia intact, which means there is a way out of this someday to restore a person again or resurrect him. But now somehow and here and there, and then only in cities, and then for money, and this is not a fight for life, but childhood, and its ruble, and it turns out to be a trade in knowledge (and knowledge is given to us through the Divine mind), this is the great sin of people.

<…> Read the article by N. F. Fedorov “The Sanitary Question”160, and you will learn what can be done and what cannot be done, it is said simply and clearly, what to do and how to arrange this matter so that it is for the benefit of all mankind and for life, and when a person is healthy, then he works, and all mankind will be healthy and will all work, and from work everything will be done that will be needed by all mankind, and “all mankind is a kind of force that can work miracles. To all this we must add the Autocracy, which we absolutely need, due to our minority, the Autocrat, as the Father of the people and the forefather of forefathers, living and dead. We, due to our minority, can easily deviate from human affairs and go the wrong way, which Fedorov explained to us, but the autocracy will keep us on one Divine path, which will lead us to eternal life. We must all be in the service of the autocracy, each person must bring his knowledge and abilities to the autocracy and to all humanity, in the name of eternal life, and we will fight our enemy, blind nature, with the help of faith in God and autocracy and the Church of Christ, and we will come out of darkness to light, from childhood to reason, and our entire existence with all its worries and sufferings will be erased.

Gradually, everything that is deadly on our nurse earth, and all this deadly we must take as a rule for all humanity to transform into a life-giving force. Not to cooperate with the blind force of nature, but to counteract it, always and everywhere, not in offices and cities, but in the open and in all villages and hamlets, throughout our nurse earth. Then our life will be interesting, everything will be new and interesting everywhere and in everything, the Foundation has been dug up about life and its meaning, the beginning has been laid and explained to us by N.F. Fedorov.

After reading it, everything became old, unsightly, our real life, existence. I say, my dear brother, <…> in the past I did not speak like this, in such language, then the language was party, and now it is universal. Now there is something to think and consider, and speak, and do for all of humanity. A new beginning of life has come for everything. What was and is now will go down in eternal history. How much life and meaning there will be. Inaction and non-thinking, as in Leo Nikolaevich Tolstoy, this mistake of all humanity will not be repeated. All our mistakes in life have been and passed, and another time has come in a reasonable sense!

December 1, 1913. Moscow. I<ona> P<anteleymonovich>. I only yesterday had the opportunity to read your two books162, and I confess that they have thrown me into considerable confusion. I am not talking about the artistic side of your works: from this side I recognize many of your poems as very successful and can only wish for your talent to grow further. I am confused (I will be frank!) in the first book by the very proud and unpeaceful tone of your prefacel63, as well as many thoughts in the book itself. In the collection of poems, eroticism is mixed, often ardently sensual, with religious aspirations, and overly bold images with the greatest light of Christian perception. I am far from the inappropriate prank of interfering with the freedom of artistic creativity, whatever it may be. I must only frankly say that the discovered properties of your works have revealed to me their incompatibility with the spirit, sympathies and goals of N. F. F-v. With his ascetic attitude to sensuality, as well as with his great personal modesty, the traits I mentioned are completely inconsistent. And this is what perplexes me: how can you thoughtfully combine such ecstasies and such powers attributed to yourself with following the ideas of N. F.? If you insist on the possibility of such a combination, I am forced to think that you misunderstand the teaching of my Elder, that you have not only failed to penetrate into its spirit and goals, but are far removed from them. And this conclusion makes me look with great apprehension at how you plan to conduct your “universal work.” In any case, on the basis of the foregoing, I appeal to you with a decisive request that until your collection164 is published, you not consider me as participating in your work in any way whatsoever and not mention my name and surname in the Collection or in any announcements about it as a person participating in your work. I am obliged to this demand by the same sincerity and directness that, of course, motivates you in this case and which I, of course, fully respect, although in this case I cannot share those expressions of it that were expressed in your work. Confident that my request will be fulfilled exactly, and hoping that you will not interpret it in any other sense than the direct one that is set out here, I remain with the utmost respect, V.K.

Dear Sir, highly respected
Vasily Vasilyevich!

I read in your article “The Ideological Disputes between L. N. Tolstoy and N. N. Strakhov” (No. 13548 of Novy Vremya) that Strakhov wrote to Tolstoy: “I will defend art and science with all my might against you (Tolstoy), Solovyov, and against Nikolai Fyodorovich”165 (by the latter Strakhov meant the author of “The Philosophy of the Common Cause”), and I felt very bitter that you left this passage unnoticed, without explaining how wrong Strakhov was in relation to Fyodorov, who himself always reproached Tolstoy for his disdainful attitude toward science. Thus, on page 366 of volume 2 of “The Philosophy of the Common Cause,” defending science against Tolstoy, Fyodorov says: “The exposure of the vice of scientists constitutes the great merit of Count Tolstoy; but these denunciations should not go over into a denial of science itself; you can’t throw a fur coat into the oven when fleas have started up in it, as Count Tolstoy himself figuratively put it.” I ask you to read the entire article from which this expression is taken, on pp. 362-398 of volume 2 of “Philosophy of the Common Cause,” under the title “Inaction or Fatherly and Brotherly Deed.” You won’t regret it if you read it; your time will not have been wasted. This article was written at the very beginning of the last decade of the 19th century, sent anonymously to Tolstoy, and then it was supposed to be published, but the censors forbade its publication. — The importance that Fedorov attached to science is evident from the following passage in Volume 1 of the Philosophy of the Common Cause, on pp. 143–144: “In trying to understand why the resurrection of Christ was not followed by a general resurrection, our goal is not to justify Christianity from an imaginary contradiction, as is done by those who believe in the power of civilization and those who do not believe in the strength of Christianity, but to save history from humiliation by raising it to the realization of the ‘Good News’, i.e. we accuse scientists, defending their own works, condemn them for an incorrect assessment, for belittling the value of their own works, for the fact that they humiliate their work, considering it pointless.” <…> The great significance of art is mentioned, among other things, in excerpts from Fedorov's yet unpublished articles in a letter that I sent about a month and a half ago to Mr. Engelhardt, who did not answer me and did not respond to this letter in Novoye Vremya. <…>

I consider it necessary to warn you that a certain Iona Brikhnichev, one of the defrocked priests who published Novoye Vino in Moscow, for some reason became imbued with respect for N. F. Fedorov and is preparing some kind of collection in his memory. And V. A. Kozhevnikov and I were careless enough to give Brikhnichev one little article, published in 1897 in the Voronezh newspaper Don and which will be published in the 3rd volume, and another letter to me, written back in the seventies of the last century166. We gave this to Brikhnichev because a certain Gorsky is participating in the company with him in publishing the collection, about whom the Florensky you know speaks very well, as an extremely pure person. But then I read Brikhnichev's work "The Fiery Sower"167, a work of empty content and the greatest impudence, testifying that Brikhnichev is completely unfamiliar with Fedorov's works. This makes one fear that the image of N. F. Fedorov in the collection published by Brikhnichev will be distorted. I thought it necessary to warn you about this.

Sincerely devoted to you
N. Peterson.

End of December 1913. St. Petersburg
Dear Nikolai Pavlovich!

There is absolutely no literature about Nikolai Fedorovich Fedorov. And this circumstance is of considerable importance for clarifying an objective assessment of N. F.'s teachings; thanks to which it is possible to misunderstand and misrepresent his real views. Well, these are, of course, all the difficulties that one always encounters when working on issues that have not yet been fully explored. But that is not the point. Even what has been written about N. F. (I mean Vladimir Aleksandrovich Kozhevnikov's experience of presenting his teaching) has to be found during the day with fire. Our Academic Library does not have this book. I asked to order it, but when this will happen is unknown. I have been to the public library four times, everyone is looking for it there and asking me to come back sometime. Time, of course, does not wait and goes by itself. Not knowing where Vladimir Aleksandrovich is at the present time, I decided to turn to you with a request - can you, Nikolai Pavlovich, help me out of trouble - get the necessary book171.

By the way, please let me know (if I am not bothering you with all this) whether the third volume of Fedorov has come out. I was told that it has come out. I always look through the bibliographic news for each month and have not come across it there. I also checked in the Public Library, but without success.

N. F. captivates me more and more every day. I am amazed at the depth and originality of the thought of this humble old man with the heart of a Gospel child. I would like to see his portrait. Has it survived?

If you can, Nikolai Pavlovich, then please fulfill my request, for which I will be infinitely grateful to you.
Yours sincerely, Mikhail Krotkov.

<…> I have not yet had time to inform you that at the editorial meeting of Put it was decided to familiarize yourself with Golovanenko’s manuscript172 (Grigory Alekseevich173 wants to do this, but I will first discuss this with you). In itself, this is not a refusal and has some chance of acceptance, but I do not know whether it is convenient to inform a young author of such a response, especially in view of a possible refusal. <…>

Dear Nikolai Pavlovich!

I received your letter of January 12 only today, the 21st. The reason for this is that it arrived in my absence.

I am surprised that your son did not receive the letter I sent with the notification of receipt of V.A. Kozhevnikov's book. I sent the letter the very next day, as soon as the book reached me. Together with the letter to you, I am sending a second letter to your son today. I still need Kozhevnikov's book. At present, I have begun writing my dissertation, so sometimes I have to turn to it for information. As soon as the work is finished, I will immediately send it to you in Zaraysk. Therefore, I humbly ask you to wait a little.

I am very grateful to you, benevolent Nikolai Pavlovich, for your kind offer to send me a copy of the letter to Trubetskoy174. Your answer is, of course, interesting to me, and if it does not bother you to fulfill this offer, then I would be happy to get acquainted with your polemical answer.

I read Golovanenko's article175 quickly, right on the way from home. December I did not live in St. Petersburg, but in a remote province where they do not subscribe to the "Bogoslovsky Vestnik". I learned about this article from V.A. Kozhevnikov, when I stopped by to see him while passing through Moscow (January 20).

A propos176 V.A. Kozhevnikov was sick with pneumonia. Now he has almost recovered and is walking.

Due to the extremely superficial reading of the article, I cannot say much about it. It only seems to me that it is good that there are people interested in N.F. Fedorov and who consider him from their own point of view. The point of view may turn out to be incorrect, but Fedorov's teaching will not suffer from this at all; on the contrary, thanks to the comprehensive coverage, it will stand out in relief against the general background of religious and philosophical systems, and in the lemmatic disputes will better reveal the truth that is hidden unnoticed by most in the Philosophy of the Common Cause.

As for Golovanenko, it seems to me that he is not quite right when, considering the Philosophy of the Common Cause mainly from the epistemological side, he forgets to note the moral side of Fedorov's teaching. Meanwhile, Fedorov's philosophy is valuable in a moral sense. And if Golovanenko had brought the moral side to the forefront, then Fedorov's Gnosticism (to which he was an opponent) would have received a completely different meaning in Golovanenko's eyes...177

I apologize for the concern I have caused you, albeit involuntarily, independently of me.
Your respected student
Mikhail Krotkov.

By the way, do you know, Nikolai Pavlovich, whether Brekhnichev's book has been published178 and where I can get it? I still can't find out anything about it.

Pavel Alexandrovich!

Along with this registered parcel I am sending you my note regarding Mr. Golovanenko's article in the "Theological Herald"180. I would be very glad if you found it possible to publish it, of course, with a response, as my note was published in "Problems of Philosophy and Psychology"181. For a greater clarification of what is being discussed, I consider it necessary to send you a copy of my letter to Prince Trubetskoy, sent to him after the publication of my note and the response to it182. At the end of the letter I warn Prince Trubetskoy, that my letter can be published, but this letter is not published and cannot be published, because Vladimir Alexandrovich Kozhevnikov found it inconvenient to publish it. I am also sending you my confession of faith, written a year ago after a meeting in M. A. Novoselov's circle183. If you find it necessary, it could be published.

<…> I read with great interest about your perplexities regarding your work on the philosophy of Father Serapion184. I understand your mood very well; I have experienced and am still experiencing something similar regarding Nik. Fed-ch, whom I highly value, love dearly, and with whom I still cannot agree on some essential things. When I tried to introduce him, little by little, into our public consciousness, I made every effort to precisely merge with him in presenting his thoughts; and I was even reproached for the fact that it was often impossible to distinguish whether I was speaking on behalf of F-v or on my own behalf. But I am convinced that only such a related, consonant in spirit, presentation of the thinker is correct, at least for an initial acquaintance with him: criticism belongs at the end. That is why I think that you, too, should introduce your own, also “Enigmatic Thinker,” into understanding with a related presentation, “congenial,” as Herder said, and not immediately analytical and critical. I see the difficulty of this task given your current impossibility of uniting with your thinker in many ways. And yet, I think, his presentation should come first, as objective as possible, without weakening the first impression with criticism. Let him be recognized and loved at the beginning of the book as he is in his entirety (and with his shadow sides); and then correct yourself what you think is erroneous or dangerous. With your multifaceted soul, I know you will find enough in tune to introduce the reader to the understanding of the thinker not only by cold exposition, but also by warm sympathetic feeling. And the exposure of dissonances should be at the end... <…>

Your Excellency
Nikolai Petrovich!

I inform you of the receipt of your manuscripts and at the same time ask you to answer a question of this kind that arises in me:

Of course, the significance and mystery of the teaching and personality of N. F-ch makes one want the most comprehensive study of his teaching and his personality. In this sense, I find the publication of your reply to Mr. Golovanenko not only acceptable, but also positively desirable. But is it appropriate to publish it now, when with the February issue the printing of not a short note, but a detailed study of N. F. Fedorov by the same author begins, which will drag on for several months 185.

It is possible that after the publication of this study, the reasons for your accusation of Mr. Golovanenko's misunderstanding of N. F. Fedorov's teaching will become more clear, or, on the contrary, you will renounce some of your accusations. I would think that in the interests of a calm clarification of the matter it would be advisable to let Mr. Golovanenko speak out to the end, and then polemicize with him. Do not think that I am simply delaying the polemic—I am sincerely glad of it, both because it enlivens the journal and for the sake of a multifaceted coverage of N. F. Fedorov's teaching. You will have the opportunity to comment on the works (both together) of Mr. Golovanenko after he has finished printing his research, which is already in typesetting.

Yours truly 

I ask you to tell me what you think about the proposed combination. If you are dissatisfied with it, I will refer this matter to the arbitration court of our mutual friend Vl. Al-cha Kozhevnikov, and I will do as he decides. Mr. Golovanenko's work is now being published with his consent (he, however, did not read it and judged it by his first article).

Thank you for sending a letter to Prince E. N. Trubetskoy. This letter seems extremely valuable to me, and I think that if it is inconvenient to publish it in its present form, then it should be published not as a response to Prince E. N-cha, but as a biographical note, which is very important when studying the biography of N. F-cha. Think about whether you will find it possible to make the appropriate alterations in it and publish it in the "Bogoslovskiy Vestnik"?

Your humble servant

Priest Pavel Florensky.

Dear Sir
Pavel Alexandrovich!

I express my heartfelt gratitude to you for the notification of receipt of the manuscripts sent to you. As for the publication of my note regarding Mr. Golovanenko's article, if Mr. Golovanenko for some reason found it necessary to publish his article before his great work on the works of N. F. Fedorov, then it seems to me that it would be fair to publish my note regarding this article, without waiting for the great work, because many, having read Mr. Golovanenko's article and not having found a response to it, may refuse to become acquainted with Fedorov's works, because they will believe that the work to which Fedorov's works call is in fact some kind of magic, that in fact Christian hope is being eliminated by him186.

If you do not find it possible to publish my note in the Theological Herald, I ask that you return it to me, I will try to publish it elsewhere in order to prevent Mr. Golovanenko's harmful influence on the distribution of N. F. Fedorov's works.

Regarding the letter to Trubetskoy, I would like to publish it, but V. A. Kozhevnikov is against it. On February 8, 9 and 10, I think I will be in Moscow and will talk with Vladimir Alexandrovich about reworking this letter and publishing it in a revised form in the Theological Herald. After the talks with Vladimir Alexandrovich, I will inform you of the results of these talks, and perhaps I will even send you an article. You have not told me anything about the confession of faith that recognizes immanent resurrection, i.e. resurrection through man? Can it be published in the Theological Herald and, of course, with the appropriate objection?

<…> Thank you for the information about Nikolai Pavlovich’s deeds. Nikolai Fed-ch himself was afraid of his “zeal beyond reason”: when he bequeathed his manuscripts to me, he made it my duty not to entrust their fate, on the one hand, to unbelieving rationalists who (he said) “will not fail to grant me the rank of general of atheism, an honor that I have not earned, although perhaps I have given some reason to think otherwise,” and on the other hand, not to give the manuscripts to Peterson, “zeal beyond reason,” and, in N. F-ch’s opinion, in this sense more dangerous than the enemies with whom (the old man added good-naturedly) “we will somehow still cope.” He expressed these precautions more than once in letters to me, which I was forced, of course, to hide from Nikolai Pav-ch; and N. P., not knowing this, often did much contrary to my opinion and repeatedly worsened the situation, which was already unenviable. His naivety reached the point, for example, that he wrote to Stolypin about the need to base the transformation of the Russian system on the ideas of N. F-ch; he wrote about the same to Shcheglovity187; he wanted to write to Sabler188; he tried to appeal to the Emperor himself; and recently he sent an appeal in the same sense to a member of the State Duma, a Cadet at that. Such zeal and such love for the Teacher are, of course, touching in themselves, especially if you know from what a kind, good person and truly righteous man these feelings come. But these impulses do not help the “cause” in the least, but rather harm it. I agree with you that the speech against Trubetskoy made sense; but to force the situation to the point of leading the opponent to the alternative of "either N. F. or the Gospel" was harmful, and most importantly, unfounded, for N. F.'s teaching, according to his own conviction, should not at all lead to such disastrous radicalism. It is necessary to recognize in this teaching much that is not clear, some things are unfounded, some things are far-fetched; it is necessary, finally, to bring into account its clashes in some essential points with church teaching, despite the author's sincere desire to remain Orthodox. All this should lead to an explanation, an investigation of the teaching, to its comprehensive discussion, of course, with complete freedom of opinion, a freedom for which the "Old Man" always stood openly and energetically. Nikolai Pavlovich, having recognized not only N. F-ch’s teaching but also his presentation as “divinely inspired” (as he recently admitted to me in a letter), cannot calmly tolerate those who think about this teaching in any other way than he does, and he accuses everyone in a row of not understanding Fedorov. What kind of a scientist would this be? and what would be its value if no one really understood it except one (N. P.), for he counts me not so much among those who do not understand the “teaching” as among its traitors, for the fact that I do not follow the advice to begin and end each article or each reading with the propaganda of N. F.’s ideas. The unpopularity and inaccessibility of the teaching was not terrible for many thinkers, and for many of them it was downright desirable; at least, they claimed this and boasted of it. But what can one say about a teaching that is intended for everyone, necessarily for everyone, and does not assert itself without the assistance of the majority, and which at the same time is incomprehensible to no one or is misunderstood by almost everyone? How many times have I pointed out to N. P. that by asserting this he is “failing” N. F., but all my admonitions have led to nothing. The same thing now! He hid his speech against Golovanenko from me, probably out of fear that I might stop him. I don’t know the contents of the article, but in principle I fully share your opinion that if Golovanenko is going to publish a whole work on Fedorov, then, of course, it would be better to wait until it is published in full and then respond. Nikolai Pavel will come to see me in a few days (he is coming to Moscow on the 8th), and then I will make every effort to persuade him to be patient until Golovanenko’s articles are published; I hope I will succeed. I would ask you not to give in to his request to publish his article right away, for I am convinced that this will only harm the cause. I will explain to Peterson that your refusal does not in any way contain any injustice or prejudice. As for Peterson's own "Confession of Faith," if this is what he read me a draft of earlier, then I would be even more unwilling to see this thing printed, and I do not understand why the editors of the "Bogoslovskiy Vestnik" can be obliged to print it? I will talk about this too and immediately inform you. <…>

<…> I am sending you an article by N. P. Peterson (regarding the article by Prince E. N. Trubetskoy): it has now been given the form not of a letter, but of a note on the article189. There is nothing polemically sharp in it, and the factual data are not without interest. Nik. Pavel. would very much like to see this article printed in the "Bogoslovskiy Vestnik" and asks you about it. Will you not find it possible to fulfill this request? 190

Nik. Pavel has decided to refrain from speaking out against Golovanenko for now. <…>

<…> I have read Golovanenko’s articles about Fedorov191. I liked their clarity of presentation; they provide a concentrated bouquet of Fedorov and thus an immanent criticism. Therefore, as far as one can judge from what I have read about the rest, I could support this work on the Way even for independent publication. However, having inquired with Gri<igory> A<lekseevich>ch192, the “Minister-President,” I learned from him that our economic plan for the next year or two, calculated for the translations we have planned and the original publications we have already agreed upon, does not allow for expansion, and a brochure about Fedorov is not the kind of mayor for whom one can always find a place. Based on this information, I decided not to pursue the matter further. If, against all expectations, the essay is published in the “Bogoslovsky V<estnik>”, then I hope to conduct it through the Path, therefore, without expenses (almost), otherwise no. I feel sorry for G<olovanenko>, but vis major193. <…>

Dear Valery Yakovlevich! You have probably already received and managed to familiarize yourself with the collection “The Ecumenical Cause”195.

From all those who have read your letter “about death, resurrection and resurrection”196 placed there, I have had to and have to hear the same question, which I could not resolve for myself and wanted to ask you personally about it, but forgot, namely: what do you mean when you speak in the final lines of the letter about the second coming, which seems to you the most probable limit of the rebirth?

Are we talking about metempsychosis or something else? In the first case, the question goes to the plane in which it is taken at least in the article by V. Nedzvetsky197.

I would very much like to know in general about your impression of this article, my work on Soloviev198 and the entire collection in general. The sheet with the list of misprints, transpositions and omissions was printed only the other day. Without this, the book could not have been released to the market.

I have just reread Vyach. Ivanova in Works and Days "On the Boundaries of Art". It sums up the great debate that began once on the pages of Apollo199. The surrender of arms is complete. It turns out that beauty (in art) no longer saves the world and should not save it. The artist is now invited from the most real to the real (like the Acmeists?). Why was it necessary to call the army and go with boasting? The titmouse has made a name for itself, but the seas have not settled.

Only now do I see that the inner rightness in this debate was entirely on your side, despite the paradoxical—deliberately—banal form in which you clothed your thought. You this premature noise was offensive already because you wanted to set the sea on fire not as a joke.

You—firstly—stand for the closest inseparable union of art and science—secondly, you set them a very definite goal: victory over death. And where art and science are gathered together in the Name of such a goal, there, of course, is theurgy in their midst.

And there are no limits to such art and there cannot be any, in which Vl. Soloviev and Fedorov were unanimous.

And here every descent is at the same time an ascent. No one has ascended to heaven except the Son of Man who came down from heaven, always remaining in heaven.

If this is not too difficult for you, I would like to receive at least a brief explanation regarding the “second coming”.

Respectfully yours
A. Gorsky.

Odessa, Pirogovskaya, 7.

P. S. Recently a young publishing house "Polyhymnia" was founded here with the aim of uniting southern poets and artists.

By May they want to publish the poetry Almanac "Solnechny Put"200, and by autumn a collection is being prepared, which will include fiction and articles on art and culture.

K. Balmont, A. Bisk, S. Gorodetsky, Vl. Lensky, L. Stolitsa, S. Frug, Dm. Censor, A. Fedorov and others took part in the first one.

The editors were extremely eager to have your poem or at least permission to put your name in the prospectus for autumn.

It seems that they want to ask you about this by telegram.

Dear Nikolai Pavlovich!

Now that the work on Nik. Fedorov<ich> Fedorov is finished and has already been submitted to the professor for review and evaluation, allow me to express my deep gratitude to you for the assistance you have shown me in my work. For your constant readiness to help and for your services, I must say, repeated, I thank you once again.

It is difficult for me to judge how the work has been done. A more or less objective review by the professor will show this. For my part, I have tried to do everything I could. True, now, if I were to take up the work on Fedorov again, I would do it differently.

By the way, if you are interested in knowing the contents of the dissertation I wrote, I can tell you its table of contents. Here it is:

1) N.F. Fedorov (biographical essay).

2) General character of Fedorov's philosophy.

3) Philosophy of the common cause and its tasks.
The question of the "non-brotherly, non-related" state of the world (this is the general title)

4) Non-brotherhood.

5) Philosophy of discord and its main representatives.

6) Science before N.F. Fedorov's court.

7) Theology.

8) Society by type of organism.

9) Nature (world) and man.
Supramoralism (general title)

10) Brotherhood.

11) Resurrection.

12) Regulation of nature.

13) Apotheosis of N.F. Fedorov.

14) Critical remarks on the philosophy of the common cause. A total of 211 printed pages came out.

Along with this letter I am sending you my brochure about Fedorov. At first I thought of placing the few lines I had quickly jotted down about N. F. as a note in some newspaper; but then, when I failed to achieve this, I decided to place them in "The Wanderer." They were placed in the February book201 in the latter.

Nikolai Pavlovich! Please inform me what you need to return from what you sent me. Of course, V. A. Kozhevnikov's book must be returned to you. And what should I do with the manuscripts you sent me: 1) a response to Trubetskoy 2) Golovanenko 3) an article by N. F. Fedorov: "What to call the year when..."202 To this we must also add "Bulletins of Literature and Life"203. Perhaps there is something you do not need and I can keep it for myself, for which, of course, I would be very, very grateful to you. Or perhaps the manuscripts you need can be held until the summer, when I can make copies of them when I am free.

Nikolai Pavlovich, will you be living in Zaraysk this summer? If so, I will try, if of course it is possible, to visit Zaraysk and see you.
Yours sincerely, Mikhail Krotkov.

7/V 14

P.S. Nikolai Pavlovich! I would most humbly ask you to send me the third volume of N. F. when it comes out. For me, having met him, everything concerning him, and especially his works, would be very interesting. My permanent address will be: Yerakhtur, Ryazan province, Kasimovskaya street.

In the meantime, I am in Petersburg, where I will stay until June 10th.

<…> I am rereading the 2nd volume to fish out all the misprints in it, and what amazing things are there, for example, the article "On Orthodoxy and the Symbol of Faith", which, among other things, says - "This faith is inseparable from confidence in God's constant help for the fulfillment of what is desired, that is, confidence in the love of God the Father, confidence in the grace of the Son of God," etc.204 And after this, V<ladimir> A<leksandrovich> nevertheless says that N. F-ch has nothing about grace, that according to his thought, everything is accomplished without grace. They do not understand the requirement of general holiness, and not just individual holiness; they do not consider God's constant help to be grace; they need help for an individual, and they consider only such help that is clearly manifested to be grace. Isn't everything written by N.F.-than could have been written by him without the participation of grace. <....>

Dear
Vasily Vasilyevich!

I express my deep gratitude to you for returning my manuscript and for the kindnesses that you tried to say to me in your letter205. You say that I walk with my head held high. In vain - I am too depressed by the fact that no one listens to me, that I am deprived of the opportunity to even speak out. And N. F-ch never carried his head high, but he could endure inattention to himself, because he was too rich internally, and for me inattention is incomparably more burdensome. If it were not for V. A. Kozhevnikov, then everything that remained after N. F-ch would have had to perish; but even now, when much has already been printed, and everything else will be printed, all this may nevertheless be lost, drowned in a sea of ​​printed paper, because there is no herald with a loud enough voice to draw attention to it. One hope is in God, that He will not allow the work of His true servant to die out. You write that in Fedorov's idea everything seems too mechanical, external to you. But for Fedorov nothing was more repugnant to the mechanical, the laboratory, the factory, nothing was more repugnant to the "homunculus". And if Fedorov's idea seems mechanical to you, it is only because you have not familiarized yourself with it. You say that the method is too old-fashioned in godlessness; However, only Fedorov's idea converted me, an atheist and a revolutionary, to God, refreshed my heart, as well as the heart of V.A. Kozhevnikov, who, according to him, always toured the Kremlin before meeting N.F-m, because it was disgusting to him, - filled Kozhevnikov's heart with love for this very Kremlin, for his homeland. P.I. Bartenev thanked N.F-ch for distracting his children from atheism and hatred for their fatherland, from the revolution. The famous Barsukovs, three brothers, Bartenev's nephews, at least, as I undoubtedly know, two of them were directed to fruitful activity by N.F. Fedorov206. Only Fedorov's idea can influence our godless, revolutionized intelligentsia youth.

You ask why I do not want to publish an article in "Questions"227? I really want to place it somewhere, but they won’t publish it, they won’t publish it, of course, in Voprosy, just as they didn’t publish it in Bogoslovsky Vestnik, although Florensky, having read my letter to Trubetskoy in response to his objection to my note in Voprosy, himself said and even asked that the letter be rewritten into an article, promising to publish it in Bogoslovsky Vestnik, and then it turned out that the rector of the academy was against such publication. Then I turned to you, and if you carefully read my letter with which the article was sent, you will see that I asked you to place it somewhere, and not necessarily in Novoye Vremya. Novoye Vremya is preferable to others, as a widely distributed newspaper, but if you had sent my article to Voprosy or somewhere else, I would have been equally grateful to you, because the article you sent would have been published, but if I had sent it, it would not have been published. Here we go again—Golovanenko has begun to publish his large work on the Philosophy of the Common Cause; the first article was published in the April issue of the Bog<oslovsky> Vestnik, I read it and did not notice anything special; and when I began to read the second article in the May issue, I was immediately struck by the inaccuracy of the presentation of the contents of the book, and when I began to compare the texts with the footnotes at the bottom of the page, I came across many distortions208. Now Golovanenko only expounds Fedorov’s works, and then he will criticize him, and S. N. Bulgakov tells V. A. Kozhevnikov that Golovanenko’s criticism is destructive. And so I will be deprived of the opportunity to say and prove that Golovanenko is destroying himself, and not Fedorov’s idea. You must agree that the situation is painful. In such a situation you cannot go with your head held high. I will try to send the article to Voprosy, but I do not think that it will be published there. My first note was sent to Voprosy by Trubetskoy with his devastating objection, but Trubetskoy will not send this article to Voprosy. Convey my deep gratitude to your daughter for her attention to me and bow to her from me deeply209. You yourself are burdened and you have no time to answer my letters, why don’t you entrust your daughter to answer me; there is nothing shameful in this, I am an old man, 13 years older than you, I am 71 and my eldest son is 46 years old.

What right do I have to condemn or be angry with you, but I am upset, nothing can be done about it, although I am still grateful to you for some attention to me. Forgive me for the inconvenience I cause you. Sincerely devoted to you, N. Peterson.

Dear Sir Fyodor D<mitrievi>vich!

After the war and, let us hope for God's mercy, a victorious war, a new structure for Poland, Galicia, and Hungarian Rus will be forthcoming — and in this case they cannot help but turn to you for your opinion. It seems to me that we should also listen to the opinion of the author of the "Philosophy of the Common Cause", N. F. Fedorov, whom you Although you did not know him personally, you saw and cannot doubt his complete sincerity, his ardent love for people, and especially for Russian people, his vast intelligence and erudition. Therefore, I have decided to make N. F-ch's opinion known through you, and for this purpose I am sending you his appeal to General Kireyev211, which ultimately took on such a tone that it was never sent to Kireyev. I hope that by sending you this article, I am also fulfilling the will of the deceased, who, as is evident from the note on the first page of the article, did not consider it possible to address his works to a wide public, but only to people of mature convictions. This article is intended for publication in the 3rd volume of the "Philosophy of the Common Cause". I know that due to your eye disease it is difficult for you to read what is written, therefore, if you wish, I will come to Moscow myself to read you the article I am sending you, and perhaps to discuss it. I have Saturday and Sunday free from my official duties. I take this opportunity to send you along with this registered parcel my article, which has just come out of print, “On the religious character of the teaching of N. F. Fedorov”212. I am ready to read this article to you myself.

Please accept the assurance of my deep respect and complete devotion.

Dear Sir
Nikolai Pavlovich!

Your letter of January 10, with a copy of N. F. Fedorov's article attached,214 has been lying on my desk for several months now, as a clear reproach and irrefutable evidence of my inadequacies in correspondence. I could cite some mitigating circumstances in my favor (my son-in-law's illness and my own), but I would rather not cite anything in my defense, but simply bring you my guilty head in the hope of your indulgent attitude and then get straight to the point.

You are sending me Nikolai Feodorovich's article in view of the forthcoming new structure of Poland, Galicia and Hungarian Rus, for which, in your opinion, they "cannot fail to turn" to me. In this regard, first of all, I consider it necessary to inform you that I have not taken any part in either state or public affairs for a long time, and therefore no one has turned to me and, of course, will turn to me for any advice on the issue of the structure of the countries you named. On my own behalf, and also on behalf of some of my friends and acquaintances, I think I might perhaps express in the form of an article or note some of my thoughts specifically on the question of the future fate of Poland. But if the publication of this article or note does take place, it will be a completely private enterprise.

Of course, in carrying out this concern it is useful to listen to every voice, especially the voice of a man who enjoys such general respect as N. F. Fedorov. To my greatest regret, however, having carefully read the article you sent me, I found absolutely no indications in it that specifically concern Poland. The measures he proposes may be necessary in Poland as well, but in any case, only when they are adopted and, as far as possible, implemented in Russia itself. And it is also a big question whether they are applicable to Poland without any changes. Adaptation to local conditions will be required, if only because Poland is a Catholic country, and Nikolai Fyodorovich's proposals are apparently calculated for an Orthodox environment.

Thus, it seems to me not entirely clear what, in fact, could be extracted from the article you sent for the needs of the countries you named. If you do not pursue an immediate practical goal in this case, but only wish that "the opinion of Nikolai Fyodorovich become known through me," then, to my greatest regret, I cannot assume this responsibility.

I have the utmost respect for Nikolai Fyodorovich as a person of high spiritual order and as a man whose word never diverged from his deeds. But I absolutely cannot share his views and take responsibility for their dissemination. As far as I can judge from the little that I know from the writings of Nikolai Fyodorovich, he had truly Christian aspirations. But the methods he proposed for achieving his intended goal were completely at odds with this. Purely external means, which had no value from a Christian point of view, came to the forefront. He was looking for a common cause in which all people who wanted to be Christians not only in name could unite; he found this task in the struggle with the deadly forces of nature by means of the united forces of science and the state, and by these same means he hoped to achieve the highest final goal of mankind - the resurrection of the dead. Whatever our attitude to this view in essence, it seems to me quite clear that it has nothing in common with Christianity. It would be completely in vain to look for the moral element inherent in Christianity in it: there is no talk of the struggle with sin, of the spiritual rebirth of mankind, and the resurrection of the dead itself seems to be some kind of mechanical act, accomplished not by the power of God, but by the most ordinary human forces, only united in their aspirations.

Perhaps I am mistaken in my attitude to the teaching of N. F. Fedorov, but you will easily agree that I cannot disseminate this teaching. Therefore, do not blame me for not undertaking to fulfill your order.

I am guilty before you that I have delayed my answer for so long, but you, perhaps, will understand some difficulty of my position. I did not want to upset you and therefore thought to avoid an explanation on the merits. But, having got down to business, I became convinced that such an evasion would be insincerity on my part, which can never be justified, and especially in such a great matter and in relation to such a person as you.

I conclude the letter with the most earnest request to accept my answer favorably and to believe in the unchanging feeling of my deep respect.

P.S. Please convey my regards to Mikhail Nikolaevich215, if he is with you.
Your devoted
Feodor Samarin.

<…> As for representing the interests of the deceased, of course, it is fair. I had to hear interesting reasoning from a random person: it is hard, he says, to look at people who were recently completely healthy, and now are cripples. Why on earth does one generation sacrifice itself so that others can live better? When I asked him whether we should not immediately conclude peace with the Germans and, thus, put a noose around our own necks and the necks of future generations, he answered hotly: “In no case, but justice demands that all these crippled people be reborn somehow.” At this point the conversation was interrupted. He spoke only of the crippled, having forgotten about the dead, but, in any case, one cannot help but see that the ground for accepting N. F-ch’s ideas is being created by the events themselves. <…>

My dear Nikolai Pavlovich and Yulia Vladimirovna. I send you my heartfelt greetings; and how are you, I hope you are alive and well. I live and work, but my work is being destroyed by the blind force of nature, the frost has damaged the tobacco seedlings and cucumbers. My dear Nikolai Pavlovich! How right our great Genius N. F. Fedorov was! He showed us, stupid kids, what we all need to fight against. When I read Fedorov, I feel like a stupid child, because I can’t do anything on my own, and everyone needs it for their daily bread. I recently read Berdyaev in “Russkaya Mysl”216. He calls the great Genius of the Russian land an original eccentric! This is N. F. Fedorov, who would believe Berdyaev, except those people who live in offices and have nothing to do with nature; my tongue would not turn to call N. F. Fedorov an eccentric... In all likelihood, Berdyaev himself is an original eccentric of great power! <…>

Dear and deeply respected Vladimir Alexandrovich!

From the rural wilderness I greet you on your Angel Day, which this year has turned out to be especially solemn and significant. I wish you cheerfulness and clarity from your nine-hundred-year-old patron218. I hope that your family, whom I congratulate on their dear birthday boy, are in well-being and health.

Your holiday found me in the village of Troitskoye in the Ryazan province. Only in the village does the absolute necessity of the Church become clear. The divine service here feels like it has grown out of the spirit of the people and the church service is a natural crowning of life. In addition, the canonical system is still somewhat preserved in the village. Every time I get to the village, I am again irresistibly drawn to stay there forever.

Baptism, burial, all the rites here are filled with such deep meaning and naturalness. The entire service, which in the city stands as a reproach to everything that surrounds it and, at the same time, itself artificial and, with all its external luxury, often very poor and dry, here sounds with such spontaneity that it can sometimes seem to have just arisen. And, getting to the village, I begin to look at Fedorov differently in many ways, I begin to understand his inclinations.

I still have not read your objection, Mr. Golovanenko220, and therefore I had nothing to answer you. I did not read it because I considered it a priori impossible to print an objection to an unfinished article. Mr. Golovanenko's research has been divided into separate articles at my request, for purely technical purposes; and the unity of all the articles is formally declared in the preface to the first of them. Now this research, which I accepted into the journal more than two years ago, is finished and, consequently, the question of Mr. Golovanenko's objections can be raised.

Speaking frankly, I do not sympathize at all with polemics, which usually do not clarify, but only obscure the issue. In view of this, I have already rejected polemical articles more than once, although, in essence, I was on their side. And in your case, I would very willingly publish a positive exposition of the doctrine and, in features, personality of N. F. Fedorov. In many ways I do not at all agree with Mr. Golovanenko. However, I think that an aberration of vision similar to his aberration is inevitable until you or Vl. A<leksandrovich> Kozhevnikov provide psychological and biographical colors to enable us to more vividly understand the personality, and then the teachings of N. F-ch Fedorov. I repeat, until there is a detailed biography of Fedorov, his teachings will inevitably be subject to logical forcing: much in Fedorov is unclear and ambiguous; the true meaning of his statements can be understood only in connection with his personality and biography. And without them, it remains to play on the abstractly deduced consequences of his imprecisely outlined formulas.

Along with your article against Mr. Golovanenko, I also have his extensive article against you - against your brochure221. This is what confuses me, because by publishing your objection, I lose all grounds for not publishing his article. But since you insist on publishing your objection, I have come up with the following combination:

As soon as there is free space in the journal, I will publish your article; I will send the proofs to Mr. Golovanenko, with a proposal to write you his thoughts as briefly as possible, in the form of theses, and I will publish these theses together with your article. And then I propose that both you and Golovanenko provide, for further study, positive material for the study of N. F. Fedorov, if there is any. I hope that I will be able to implement this combination in the September or October issue of the Theological Herald 222.

Your humble servant

Priest Pavel Florensky.

P. S. Would you be so kind as to send me personally your brochure against Golovanenko?

My dear
Nikolai Pavlovich

I have not forgotten about you at all. I send you my heartfelt greetings! And to your family. I live and think in the Thought of Nikolai Fyodorovich. In our villages, the Thought of Nikolai Fyodorovich is accepted in its entirety, according to the pure Divine soul, not like the city prodigal sons, like Golovanenko and Berdyaev. I read an article by Berdyaev, he wrote in the "Stock Exchange News", how Nikolai Fyodorovich predicted a real war with Germany223. Firstly, Berdyaev calls Nikolai Fyodorovich a great Thinker and at the same time calls him a utopian; and so it turns out that these different Berdyaevs are double-minded, one of their souls is white and the other is black; of course, they give more preference to the black soul than to the white one; but they should have recognized their mistake and delusion and accepted the Truth of Nikolai Fyodorovich: which is what happened with Tolstoy; and at times it becomes funny and bitter for these people, the Tolstoys and the Berdyaevs; and for the entire urban intelligentsia, who are Christians without Christ, as Golovanenko said about Fedorov. I am now studying the Pentecostarion, but it is very difficult at first, I have never even picked up Slavic books.

Goodbye, my dear Nikolai Pavlovich, and be healthy!

Vasily Nikolaev Khamutsky.

<…> Vladimir Alexandrovich wrote to me on my name day that he would soon publish his “Buddhism”224 and then it would be possible to begin finishing the works of the Great One and publish Volume III. I sincerely wish for the end of his Buddhism. The Great War will also end someday, but Nikolai F-ch’s works are still unfinished because of Buddhism.

<…> I am reading the biography of S. M. Solovyov, an older contemporary of Nikolai F-ch. I have outlined a number of such biographies in order to determine what questions preoccupied the younger generation at that time. I found several such questions, which undoubtedly also occupied N-lai F-ch: 1) about the laws to which the destinies of mankind are subject, or, what is the same, about the meaning of history, to which N-lai F-ch answers (I, 130): “There will be no meaning in history until history… is our action”; 2) the clan life of the Slavs; 3) the fascination with Hegel. Perhaps in this way it will be possible to obtain a historical perspective on the origin of N-lai F-ch’s teaching. This can probably also be helped by interrogations—yours and N-lai F-ch’s—on the Karakozov affair. I have not lost hope of getting hold of it someday. 225 But this is not an urgent task, and first of all, it seems to me, it is necessary to study N-lai F-ch’s historical views: one can rely on the one who predicted present events in constructing the future, which will immediately become the next in line after the conclusion of peace. <…>

<…> V<ladimir> A<leksandrovich> had two officers. One was a former realist, a student of D. F. Popov[10]. They said that in the trenches they read only N-ya F-cha, and not only they, but even the soldiers also hold interviews, and now, according to them, many already know who our real enemy is, against whom we must turn after the war. They took books from V<ladimir> A<leksandrovich> for the regimental commander and other officers. <…>

Dear Nikolai Pavlovich!

I just finished fiddling with my artificial iceboxes. I wanted to finish my article227 in Turkestan, which is why I bothered you, but I couldn’t do it. t there and finished only today. I have redone everything and systematized it. I am sending it along with this letter to the editors of the newspapers "Novoye Vremya" and "Russkoye Slovo" with a summary of the article (table of contents) attached and asking them to answer whether they will publish it and under what conditions. Upon receiving the answers, I will not fail to inform you. I am pleased with the results of my work so far, since whoever saw or read it, everyone expresses sympathy for my idea and hopes for its speedy implementation. This gives me courage.

On March 25, I left for vacation, and returned on May 12. I did not risk going to Verny, because I would not have had time to return in time. Everything is the same on the roads there, but it has gotten even worse than you knew. Postal communication is impossible. But to the great joy of a Semirechye resident like myself, I can say that the railway to Verny is being built, the earthworks are finished as far as Pishpek, but the rails are missing, because they are being taken to the front. I traveled along the Semirechye railway from Aras and beyond the city of Chernyaev (formerly Chimkent) one station (more than 100 versts). They say that the rails are still permitted for 40 versts. Soon, therefore, we will be traveling by rail. In view of the fact that I have not been to Verny, I cannot tell you news from there.

On leave I seemed to have rested and saved up enough sleep for five years, but, upon returning to duty, no later than two or three days later I again felt as unwell as before.

I will certainly send you my work228 as proof that the ideas of N.F. Fedorov have sunk deep into my soul. Just now one gentleman read my article and declared: "In that case the whole world will have to arm itself to fight nature!" This phrase makes me happy because I am, therefore, correctly implementing the teachings of the Great Nikolai Fyodorovich.

Deeply devoted to you
N. Sozontov.

<…> Your attention to me (I feel, not deserved to such an extent by me) You extended to the wish that I take up the compilation of "Memoirs" about myself. Although I completely rejected the idea that the impetus for them could be the assumption of some significance of myself, I, nevertheless, I confess, have often thought of putting down on paper an outline of my inner experience, only inner, for my outer life was too pale and meaningless. The impetus for such a temptation as writing my "Memoirs" was the desire to console myself, as it were, for that prolonged spiritual solitude, not often encountered by people, in which I was destined to spend the greater part of my life, and, however, the intensity and variety of my personal demands, aspirations and experiences were so great that they constantly and intensely asked to pour out, and it was painfully difficult to suppress this desire. Moreover, the unusual course of my mental and moral development, and above all the necessity in which I was placed, everywhere and in everything to break through in breadth and depth by my own personal efforts, sometimes forced me to think that the exposition of such a process of development of the soul, even if not outstanding in achievements and accomplishments, could still be of some psychological interest. So I wanted, more than once, to sit down to such auto-memorabilia, destining them first of all for myself, as a means of more accurate accounting of myself, and secondly, for my children, as a life lesson, undoubtedly instructive for those beginning in life. But each time I stopped, both because of lack of time and because of doubt that it would not be possible to create a truthful reflection of simple and yet intricate experiences and searches, that precisely their intimate side would slip away; and it is precisely this that was reverent in all this, and (in this sense) valuable. I have read many autobiographies, but how many of them can be found that are sincere and "truly faithful"?.. I accept, of course, your reservation in this direction (about the uselessness of the "Confession" and revelations of what one must repent of to God alone): it is deeply wise, but it is hardly possible to put it into practice: there is an inseparable one from the other, and if not everything is revealed in such cases, then it turns out that in these essential points, precisely the main thing will remain undisclosed, and silence inevitably risks degenerating into distortion, into substituting reality for the assumed or invented. Many other obstacles could be found, although in principle I agree with the opinion of N. F-ch that an autobiography should be obligatory for every person: for many important reasons.

And meanwhile, Nikolai Fyodorovich himself retreated before this obligation and, as if on purpose, wrapped his life story in an almost impenetrable darkness. In Volume III, it will be necessary, with great difficulty, to make an attempt at at least a scrappy restoration of information about him. And I am glad to find in you, dear Pavel Alexandrovich, sympathy for such a matter. Facsimiles can be attached to the book as much as desired, and this was provided for from the very beginning. There are almost no images, as you know, what is there will be reproduced. My friend, Nick. Pavel. Peterson, almost excommunicates me for delays. But it couldn't be arranged otherwise: my "Buddhism" is as it is, and having got into it (of course, not expecting that its difficulties would be so great), it was necessary to work it out at least to that very imperfect form in which I decided, blushing, to send you my two clumsy volumes. <…>

N. F. Fedorov220

1916. IX. 6. Serg<iev> Pos<ad>

Today Vl. Al. was with me. Kozhevnikov also answered my question about I. F. Fedorov's origins, saying that despite all his efforts and even the help of P. Bartenev, an expert in genealogical matters, very little could be found out, since Fedorov ("Old Man," as Vl. A-ch puts it) did not like to talk about it and always expressed himself as if Vl. Al-ch knew his past.

He was the son of Prince Pavel Gagarin. But who this Pavel Gagarin was, we were unable to find out. Fedorov's mother had 4 children from him - 2 sons and 2 daughters. At first they thought she was a peasant, but then it turned out that she was the daughter of a minor official - something like a collegiate registrar.

One of her sons was N. F. Fedorov, and the other was the director (?) of the Tsarskoye Selo classical gymnasium, translator of Wegner's works "Hellas" and "Rome"230.

Fedorov's mother later married Popov, the director of one of the Moscow gymnasiums.

At first she lived with Gagarin. But when his father, old Gagarin, decided to marry his son, the children were taken away from her, secretly put in a carriage and taken to another district. Fedorov remembered how she ran after the carriage and screamed...

Fedorov rarely visited his mother. She treated him badly. He apparently loved his father and spoke well of him.

That's all that Vl. Al. Kozhevnikov told me.

It is not difficult to understand what a deep connection this past of N. F-ch has with his philosophy of the family, where there is a father, brothers and sisters, but no mother, where the earthly has such a specific smell, where the feminine principle is so humiliated. Vl. A-ch Kozhevnikov readily agreed with this judgment of mine.

Dear
Nikolai Pavlovich.

I am in your great debt: I still have not answered the letter of July 16. I am very ashamed of my carelessness, and in my defense (far from complete, of course) I can only refer to the ever-increasing amount of government, official work. By the end of August she had tired me out so much that I even decided to go on a short vacation to Yaroslavl province, deep into the Poshekhonsky forests, and there forget for a while about service, about the war (as far as possible) and about everything boring into my brain and soul. I returned from this vacation recently and found your article on the name “peasant” and Russian messianism on my desk232; but since I had to immerse myself in a pile of accumulated work immediately upon my arrival, I read the article only today. A big, heartfelt thank you to you, dear Nikolai Pavlovich, for not forgetting me when you send me your articles, which I read with the same interest and pleasure as the articles of N. F. himself. And I very much regret that I cannot repay you in the same way: firstly, I write very little and rarely and, secondly, so far about things that have no relation to N. F.’s teaching and therefore are probably not interesting to you. <…>

I fully agree with your comments on my article about N. F. (the manuscript that I sent you)233. These comments convince me even more that I have not yet become sufficiently imbued with Fedorov and therefore can easily distort (in detail) his teaching. You say that it would be useful to publish the article (of course, with the corrections that you indicate are necessary). But where to publish it? I do not know of any journals suitable for this, and a separate brochure is risky: it could hopelessly end up lying around in a warehouse. By the way: when and how do you think of publishing the 3rd volume of N. F.'s works? With what funds? If these works have been published until now with funds from N. F.'s admirers (for example, yours and Kozhevnikov's), and if you are concerned about collecting and accumulating these funds, then perhaps you will allow me to take part in this matter with a feasible mite?

You ask where I disagree with N.F. So far I have not completely come to terms with his teaching on autocracy and his sharp condemnation of constitutionalism. Actually, I cannot say anything against the ideal autocracy that Fedorov preaches, but this is not a historical autocracy, and it cannot in any way be opposed to historical constitutionalism, as N.F. does. Unfortunately, I would have to write too much and for a long time about this, the question is not one of the most important (especially with regard to constitutionalism), and therefore we will postpone the details and dispute on this subject until another time. I still hope that someday fate will give us the opportunity to meet and talk in person. Letters are an extremely unsuccessful way to exchange opinions.

Sincerely devoted to you
A. Moshchansky.

I haven’t answered you for so long, dear Pyotr Alekseevich, because I was in Moscow, choosing from paper Mr. V. A. Kozhevnikov, everything related to N. F-ch, and it turned out to be a lot; I took away only what was prepared for the 3rd volume, and the greater part had to be left in the hands of the deceased's widow for now. I hope that everything will be safe. I am very grateful to you for the message about Volynsky235 and I will take advantage of the offer to write about N. F-ch in Birzhevye Vedomosti and, in all likelihood, will send an article very soon. I have long articles - a response to Berdyaev's article in the July 1915 issue of Russkaya Mysl; and also about E. N. Trubetskoy's article, published in Voprosy Filosofii i Psikhologii, about N. F-ch's relationship with Vlad. Serg. Soloviev. <…> But both of these articles, I believe, are too long for a newspaper. <…>

I am afraid that N. F-ch will not satisfy Mr. Volynsky, especially the article "Autocracy", which caused the most burning hatred towards N. F-ch in Merezhkovsky. <…>

Deeply respected and dear Sergei Mikhailovich!

Have you received my letter with the article regarding the obituary of Vladimir Alexandrovich and what have you done with this article? If "Novoye Vremya" does not want to print my article, then be so kind as to send it to Akim Lvovich Volynsky, head of the literary department of "Birzhevye Vedomosti". He is very interested in N. F-ch and through our mutual friend236 asks me to write about N. F-ch everything I find necessary, and it will be published in Birzhevye Vedomosti. I am very sorry that the article against Bulgakov was published as a separate brochure237 and was not sent to Birzhevye Vedomosti. You need to contact Volynsky through the Editorial Board of Birzhevye Vedomosti (Admiralty Canal, 15).

<…> Tara, how do you visit the Kozhevnikovs twice a week now? Ask Anna Vasilyevna when she hopes to get to the steel box in the Bank238. And could you possibly get a few copies of Philosophy from her, both Volumes I and II? When you have them in your apartment, it will be easier to get them when needed. I received a letter from Petrograd from Severov, in which he reports that he has met Volynsky, about whom Sergienko wrote to me. Volynsky is preparing a large work on N. F-che, is burning with enthusiasm for him, says that all paths and roads are open to him in the press and he can find both funds and publishers for the third volume; he proposes to begin printing immediately, and Severov invites me to his place for the duration of the printing to keep the proofreading. In addition, Volynsky proposes to begin republishing the entire work in several compact volumes immediately after the publication of Volume III, so that everyone can buy them. I immediately responded to Severov, in order to secure from Volynsky something more reliable than talk. If it turned out to be something serious, I would risk going to Petrograd. Severov writes that Volynsky is going to write to me. Let's see what comes of it239. <…>

Severov asks, among other things, whether the article by N. F-ch, which was once sent to him, Severov, for transmission to Pertsov for "The New Path", in which Nicholas II is equated with Alyosha Karamazov240, will be included in the 3rd volume. But I have not seen this article and ask Severov to help me find it. <…>

Your Holiness, etc. as appropriate

I present to Your Holiness a note on the question "What is Orthodoxy" and most earnestly ask you to forward it to the All-Russian Council for consideration. I pray to God that this question, on the solution of which much will depend, will be resolved before the Council disperses before the feast of Easter. If the Council agrees with the definition of Orthodoxy as it is made in the note, this will be the beginning of the transformation of Orthodoxy, the penetration of Christianity into life, then one can hope that the time will finally come when living and being a Christian will mean one thing, these expressions will be identical. The articles referred to in the note are attached: 1. "On the purpose and meaning of our existence", 2. "How to create a national school"242.

I must say that the definition of Orthodoxy given in the note was made by N. F. Fedorov, who died on December 15, 1903, in his works, published after his death in 2 volumes under the title "Philosophy of the Common Cause". This book is in the possession of the members of the Council of His Eminences Eulogius-Volynsky, Dimitry-Tavrichesky, Count P.N. Apraksin, Professors S.N. Bulgakov, Prince E.N. Trubetskoy, N.D. Kuznetsov - and I must say with regret that none of them, except perhaps Count Apraksin, have read these books properly, no one has understood them properly, and therefore they have not received the proper assessment. Meanwhile, the knowledge of N.F. Fedorov is recognized by many as so profound that Pokrovsky, who wrote about him in Moskovskiye Vedomosti on the fortieth day after his death,243 says that N.F. Fedorov knew the contents of all the books in the library of the Rumyantsev Museum, that N.F. Fedorov, not being a specialist, was ahead of all specialists, and cites as proof of this amazing facts. And this Fedorov, with all his thoughts, with all his soul, who devoted himself throughout his long life to one thing - the search for ways by which we can fulfill the will of God, the search for what we must do not each separately, but all together, so that the prayer - "Thy will be done" - would not be just a word and we would become instruments and executors of the will of the all-good God, who did not create death and wants everyone to come to the understanding of the truth - this Fedorov made the definition of Orthodoxy given in the note. In objection to V.S. Solovyov, who made grave accusations against contemporary Christianity in his essay “On the Causes of the Decline of the Medieval Worldview”—and Solovyov called contemporary Christianity, identifying it with the medieval worldview, not even the true one—the same Fedorov, on page 480 of the first volume of “Philosophy of the Common Cause,” says: “Contemporary Christianity should not be called untrue; it cannot be called so, for it is true, but is not yet complete either in volume or in content; it has not yet moved from words to common deeds, from secret action to overt deeds.”244 — Fedorov wants all education, all science to set as its task the search for ways to fulfill the will of God, and he sees the reason for the incompleteness of present-day Christianity in the fact that science has become the slave of the factory and trade, that science is indifferent to the disasters that are common to all people. And it is precisely the revival of science, connected with the revival of the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, pagan literature, that has led to the fact that modern science has become only a further development of pre-Christian, i.e. pagan, literature, has become not only alien, but also hostile to Christianity; so that in all educational institutions, not excluding theological seminaries and theological academies, all subjects contradict the law of God and the majority of those who reach the fifth grade of secondary educational institutions become unbelievers. The vast majority of the so-called intelligentsia, all the "educated" with the exception of an insignificant number, are unbelievers, and for them the separation of church and state is a completely normal and even the only acceptable position, and the right not to profess any religion is the inalienable right of everyone. And yet to recognize the right not to profess any religion means to recognize the right to a meaningless and aimless existence, because only religion gives purpose, and consequently, meaning to our existence. But can a meaningless existence be a moral existence? asks Fedorov in his article, published in issue No. 8, 1902, of the newspaper "Askhabad" ... 245

N. F. Fedorov is accused of rationalism. Yes, he places a high value on reason, the distinctive quality of man, but reason that shone upon us with the Nativity of Christ and His Resurrection, the reason of truth, that wisdom whose beginning is the fear of God; and not that reason which has become madness and of which it is said— I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and reject the reason of the reasonable 246; not that reason which has found its expression in all philosophy, both ancient, beginning with Socrates, and modern, in which the ancient, Socratic one was revived— in the philosophy of Descartes, Kant and their followers; not that reason, or wisdom, the beginning of which is not the fear of God, but criticism turning into blasphemy.

There are those who accuse Fedorov of socialism as well. The reason for such an accusation was the following expression on page 174 of the first volume of the “Philosophy of the Common Cause”: “at that time the thought had not yet tormented me that any further necessary use of what others are deprived of is already a violation of Christian love, the unity of mankind, a violation of the very first fundamental dogma, the dogma of the Trinity, considered as a commandment. Limitation, self-restraint must take place “In our time, not in order to become like the gods, who have no needs, as Socrates said, but from a feeling of closeness and similarity with all people.” But having said this, Fedorov on page 124 of volume 1, note 20 and on page 173 of volume II of the “Philosophy of the Common Cause” says: “Communist and socialist constructions that reject kinship, in order to hold on, must bring guardianship to the maximum, and envy, which watches that no one takes advantage of more than is due, must be elevated to the highest virtue. And from envy, this fundamental property of Satan, hatred, malice and all vices are born; so that those who assert, through stupidity, of course, that the most ideal constructions of socialist societies are impossible, unrealizable, because people are not angels, fall into a great mistake; no, they are not feasible because people are not angels, i.e. not devils."

In conclusion, it must be said that the mind that shone upon us with the Nativity and Resurrection of Christ will find its expression only in schools organized in churches and at churches, as stated in the article "How to Create a National School," published in the "Missionary Collection" of 1916, No. 12247.
What is Orthodoxy248

Until now, Christianity has lived with the [heart], with heartfelt sighs, with spiritual [tempers]. Christianity rejects the necessity of [universal] salvation, to which Christ calls us, [by the forces of]249 reason, knowledge, science, and, in addition to fasting, prayer, and good deeds performed by each individual, does not recognize the need for general, planned activity for salvation. And this is in complete contradiction with the teaching about the church, belonging to which is necessary for salvation. But in what is our belonging to the church expressed, in what is the fact that we are members of the church expressed? Is it really only in visiting the temple and in passive, as it has become at the present time, presence at divine services, at which, although others are present with us, but very often completely unknown to us, and in any case alien to us, whose mood is unknown to us, may not only not coincide with ours, but also be in direct contradiction with it. Let us imagine a master and a hired worker, a manufacturer and a factory worker, a merchant and a buyer of his goods standing side by side in a church, whose interests are directly opposed… But there is no parish life, there is no parish united in a union; [the parish could] become a kinship union [torn off leaf] if the parishioners had one common [business]. And what] can be common, if not the business of our [salvation]. If] one can be saved alone, then what [remains of] the meaning of the church? What will the service of the church consist of and how will its life be expressed? Therefore, first of all, we must think about what the common business of salvation should consist of? — Christ came down from heaven “for our salvation,” — He did not save us from sin and death, but, having come down from heaven for our salvation, He called us ourselves to participate in the work of our salvation, because, as Blessed Augustine says, God could have created us without us, but He cannot save us without us. If salvation were possible without us, then why would He, in the person of Christ, come down to earth, clothe Himself in human flesh, suffer, die, and then rise again?!.. The salvation of man, of the human race, can be accomplished only through man, through us, people. Our salvation is accomplished by God, but through ourselves, with our participation in fact, in the very construction of our salvation. Good deeds, performed by each one individually, are not yet salvation from sin and death, which is inextricably linked with sin. By performing good deeds, we do not cease to sin, and therefore we die. Good works make us worthy of salvation, but they do not build our salvation. How should the very construction of our salvation and our participation in this construction be expressed?

Christ commanded: seek ye first and above all the Kingdom of God (Matt. VI, 33; Luke XII, 31) and "all things shall be added unto you." And this establishes the necessity of our participation in the very building of the Kingdom of God. The common cause is our participation in the building of the Kingdom of God on earth. When the Kingdom of God is on earth, when the name of the Heavenly Father is hallowed on earth and His will is fulfilled as in heaven, then on earth there will certainly be neither sin nor death. They say that the Kingdom of God is within us. But the Lord answered: "The Kingdom of God is within you," to the question of the Pharisees, "when the Kingdom of God comes" (Luke XVII, 20-21). Surely Christ did not want to say by this that the Kingdom of God was within the Pharisees who were asking?!.. With these words Christ obviously wanted to say that when the Kingdom of God is also on earth, then there will be no need to ask when it will come and where it is, because then we will feel its presence within ourselves. That the Kingdom of God was not on earth when the Pharisees asked about its coming is evident from the fact that Christ Himself taught us to pray - "Thy Kingdom come" and on earth just as it is in heaven. If it were already within us, then why command "seek ye first the Kingdom of God", and how could it be said that the Kingdom of God "suffers violence", is taken by force (Matt. 11:12). There is no Kingdom of God on earth at the present time, of this we are convinced by everything that is happening before our eyes. Answering the question of the Pharisees, Christ did not say that the Kingdom of God will not come, that it already exists, that it is within us. No, Christ said that the Kingdom of God will come, but in an imperceptible way, so that it will be impossible to say, “here it is or there it is.” The question of when it will come, He left unanswered, and this, of course, is because, as Christ answered the question of His disciples about the time of the Second Coming, “of that day and hour no man knoweth… Only My Father alone” (Matt. 24:36; Mark 13:32). The Second Coming of Christ will no longer be for the sake of our salvation, but for the sake of judgment over those who neglected the call at the First Coming to take part in the arrangement of the work of our salvation, in the arrangement of the Kingdom of God on earth. The Second Coming will also have the goal of establishing the Kingdom of God on earth, but without our participation and not for those who refused to take part in its establishment. With our participation, the Kingdom of God will not be established on earth suddenly and imperceptibly - we will feel it within us. With our resistance to the will of God, the Kingdom of God will be established on earth not only obviously, but also threateningly for those who neglected the call of the Lord, for those who did not want to take part in the work of establishing it. our salvation, i.e. the Kingdom of God on earth, and thereby condemning those who wished to take part in the work of establishing the Kingdom of God to an incomplete salvation, since those who wished to take part in the construction of the Kingdom of God and who, through no fault of their own, failed to fulfill the will of God will be condemned to contemplate what the opponents of the will of God will be condemned to.

In what way can our participation in establishing the Kingdom of God on earth be expressed? First of all, our pastors must become good pastors, knowing their flock, so that the flock also knows their pastors and listens to their voice. Our pastors must not only know their flock, but also love them; and for this, the pastor must enter into the life of his parishioners with all their needs, sorrows and sufferings, and must take part in their joys. Concerning those in need and suffering, making their needs and sufferings the subject of common prayer, the pastor must inform all the other parishioners, must inform about all those in need of help and encourage them not only to pray for deliverance from the needs and sufferings of their fellow members, but also to come with real help, both spiritual and material, to come with help to those in need of food and clothing, to those in need of care and attention, whether due to illness, infirmity, or old age, to come with consolation to the distressed, with support and admonition to those who have fallen into crime.

The pastor also has the duty of teaching, which does not consist in inventing and composing sermons - in the Protestant way, but in the simple, ordinary teaching of the children of the parishioners. What is the liturgy of the catechumens, what is catechumenship, if not teaching? But it is precisely children who must be taught, and they must be baptized without catechumens; therefore, every church must be a school. Christ said: “Leave the children and do not forbid them to come to Me” (Matt. XIX, 14; Mark X, 14; Luke XVIII, 16). Consequently, the church is the most appropriate place for teaching children. The church is also the best aid in teaching: how many objects are there that everyone must know, know their significance, their meaning, beginning with vestments, vessels, icons... The church is an image of the universe, infinitely small in comparison with it, but infinitely higher than the universe in meaning, in the thought put into the church, for it is a project of the world as it should be. The church is also an image of heaven, a gadfly of heaven, with generations of the dead depicted on it, as if revived. On the iconostases, as in the Moscow Cathedral of the Dormition, as in every church, although in some cases in an abbreviated form, we see a depiction of the whole of history, beginning with Adam, the forefathers before the flood, the forefathers after the flood, the kings, the prophets, the Forerunner of the Lord, Christ, the apostles, the saints, and this to the last days. And is not this the best aid in the study of history, if we look at history as a sacred subject, the father of which was the prophet Daniel, who interpreted history as an act, the completion of which is in the hands of God, directing the faithful to the creation of the Kingdom of God on earth. Not only the pastors will be teachers, but also the entire clergy; it is necessary to involve the parishioners in teaching. Moreover, the training should be with the expansion of knowledge itself, with the study of the area where the temple is located, in all respects, in natural history and in historical archaeology, in terms of managing the blind forces of nature on which our life depends. - This will lead to the organization of a national school that will not arouse any hostility towards other peoples, on the contrary, it will lead to the unification of all peoples in the common cause of managing the blind forces of nature by which our life is now built, by which it is destroyed, life is trampled upon by life, fathers are displaced by children. Managing the blind forces of nature will lead us to the transition from temple liturgy to liturgy outside the temple, in nature itself [end of article lost].
N. P. PETERSON TO M. N. PETERSON250
July 17 (30), 1918. Zaraysk

Our dear and beloved! I must tell you that I have been dismissed from my post; tomorrow, July 31/18, I am handing over my post and will receive the last 250 rubles for the second half of July. We have just received a letter from Andrei Antonovich from Moscow in the enclosed envelope, on which the sender's address is not clear to us. Andrei Antonovich writes that he cannot come and does not even know if we are in Zaraysk; he asks to come himself and his mother and conveys Pasha's request that we all go to them in Gomel and Zvenigorodka251 and promises to obtain permission for us to enter Ukraine if we can and decide to go there. Could you not inform Andrei Antonovich that we would like to move to them as soon as possible and ask him to seek permission for us to enter Ukraine. Could this be done through the student Dashkevich, whose address we have not made out and to whom A. A.'s letter was handed in in Moscow? If you cannot find Dashkevich, could you not do this in some other way? We also ask you to find out whether permission is needed to travel to Gomel and from whom to obtain this permission? Could you help us calculate how much it will cost for three people to travel with two little ones in their arms? We will try to sell everything as quickly as possible and leave Zaraysk as soon as possible, where milk is registered and will be given only on a takanu per person. There is no point in us staying here, we are not thinking of staying in Moscow either, it would be good to drive through Moscow without even landing, if possible. Permission to enter Ukraine will only be needed in Gomel, therefore, we will not wait for it.

This is the situation we found ourselves in. It would be good if you came to Zaraysk before our departure and helped us leave. I would give you two briefcases with material for the 3rd volume; these briefcases would remain in your hands. But here is what has been discovered. Recently I have been busy composing an article in which I want to give a systematic and, if possible, brief exposition of the doctrine. I began to read the article Museum252, and it turned out that not all of it was published. By the way, there are 33 notes to the article Museum, but the text contains references only to 30 notes, there is no reference to the other three. Fortunately, I have preserved the original of the article, and it turned out that ten chetverts (2½ sheets) remained unprinted, all written in my hand. Everything printed on 65 pages was written on 83 chetverts, approximately 1⅓ chetverts per page, therefore, 6-7 pages remained to be printed; on these pages there would be indications of the last three notes. Therefore, the 3rd volume must begin with the end of the article Museum, placed last in the 2nd volume.

We will talk about when we are going to leave Zaraysk by telephone. Wouldn’t it be better for you to answer our letter by telephone, too? You can call us at a certain hour through our telephone exchange at the post office. We need to know, first of all, whether and from whom we need to get permission to leave for Gomel—from the German embassy, ​​perhaps: a wife is going to her husband (a Gomel landlord) with two children, and with them the father and mother of the Gomel landlord's wife. We recently received a postcard from Elizaveta Pavl<ovna>253, Aleksey Nikolaevich was exiled as a counter-revolutionary and his whereabouts are unknown, Ekaterina Ivan<ovna> is in Penza in the hospital, Elizaveta Pavl<ov-na> is alone with her grandchildren.

All of us, Mom, Lyuba254 with the children, and I hug you tightly.

With great love, N. Peterson.

July 17/30. Zaraysk.
Letters from various people

The letters included in this collection are varied. They convey the first, immediate reaction to becoming acquainted with Fedorov's philosophy, contain information about the perception of his ideas both in academic circles and by ordinary, simple people, and touch upon the biography of the thinker and his spiritual appearance.

1 Published according to: NIOR RSL. F. 386. K. 99. Ed. hr. 17. L. 38. Sergei Aleksandrovich Polyakov (1874-1948) - engineer, translator, collector, owner of the publishing house "Scorpion". He met Fedorov through N.N. Chernogubov. In 1902, he subsidized the reprinting of Fedorov's manuscripts for a volume of his works in the publishing house "Scorpion" (the publication was not carried out).

2 Funeral announcements about the death of N.F. Fedorov and A.V. Evreinov, the Sudzhan Marshal of the Nobility, were placed on December 16, 1903, in the announcements section of the newspaper "Russkie Vedomosti" (No. 345). The announcement of Fedorov's death was also placed on that day in the newspaper "Moskovskie Vedomosti" (No. 344, in the same issue was printed the obituary of Fedorov G.P. Georgievskiy), and A.V. Evreinov - in the newspaper "Novoe Vremya" (No. 9981).

3 Published according to: NIOR RSL. F. 386. K. 99. Ed. h. 17. L. 18.

4 V.Ya. Bryusov was the editor-in-chief of the magazine "Vesy".

5 Published from: NIOR RSL. F. 386. K/76. Unit. 17. L. 11-12. About Yu.P. Bartenev, see: Pro et contra. Book 1. Pp. 988-989.

6 This is about the obituary of N.F. Fedorov, written by N.N. Chernogubov; published in issue 1 of the magazine “Libra” (text of the obituary: Pro et cont, Book I, P. 129).

7 Published from: RGALI. F. 46. Op. 1. Unit. 596. L. 133.

8 In issue 3 of the Russian Archives for 1904, a letter from F. M. Dostoevsky to I. P. Peterson dated March 24, 1878 was published, which was a response to the presentation of the ideas of the philosopher of the universal cause sent to him by Fedorov’s student. P. I. Bartenev made the following note to the publication of the letter: “We do not know what N. P. Peterson replied to this” (Ibid. P. 403). Then N. P. Peterson wrote a separate letter to the editor of the Russian Archives, setting out the history of his appeal to Dostoevsky and Fedorov’s subsequent work on a response to the writer (published: Russian Archives. 1904. Book 2. No. 5-6. Pp. 300-301).

9 Published from: NIOR RSL. F. 657. K. 6. Unit 73. L. 2. Petr Yakovlevich Tsirkunov was a publicist who took part in the controversy surrounding the ideas of N.F. Fedorov in the newspaper “Aekhabad” in 1900-1902 (see: Fedorov. II, 439-441, Supplement, 165-175).

10 In all likelihood, one of these articles by Peterson was “A True Christian of Our Time” (Turkestan Diocesan Gazette. 1907. August 15), the second (received in manuscript) was an article dedicated to the readings of Fedorov’s works in the chambers of His Eminence. Dimitry (Abashidze) (see: Rgo et contra. Book 1. Pp. 381-390). The printed fragment of P. Ya. Tsirkunov's letter is a response to Peterson's message about these readings.

44 A draft of Peterson's letter to V.E. Cheshikhina is printed, made on the back of his letter of January 6 (Ibid. Sheet 4 rev.).

45 Letters from M.N. Peterson to N.P. Peterson are published at: NIOR RSL. F. 657. K. 5. Unit 42; K. 6. Unit 52. On M.N. Peterson, see note 120 to the correspondence between Kozhevnikov and Peterson.

46 July 3, 1909 M.N. Peterson wrote to his father: “I have now copied from the F.O.D. the places where language is discussed, and from the philological books that I have, I cite opinions that agree and disagree with N.F. Konchu—I will send them” (NIOR RSL. F. 657. K. 5. Unit of storage 42. L. 6-6ob.). In the archive of N.P. Peterson, there is an article by M.N. Peterson “On the World Language”, dated July 17, 1909, where the philosopher’s idea of ​​creating a single language through the reconstruction of the proto-language is considered (Ibid. K. 1. Unit of storage 64).

47 Rom 14:22.

48 We were unable to find this note by V.E. Cheshikhin.

49 At will (Latin).

50 Aleksey Antonovich Ginken — bibliographer, member of the St. Petersburg Bibliographic Circle, historian of librarianship. In 1911, he published an article about Fedorov in issue 1 of the magazine “Bibliotekar” entitled “The Ideal Librarian — Nikolay Fyodorovich Fedorov (A Brief Characteristic of the Deceased as a Person and a Librarian, Based on Literary Data)”. A.A. Ginken’s letter to N.P. Peterson is published in: Research Institute of Historical and Cultural Studies of the Russian State Library. F. 657. K. 5. Unit 34.

51 S.N. Bulgakov’s youngest son Ivashechka died in Crimea on August 27, 1909 from dysentery.

52 See in this book the letters of Kozhevnikov to Peterson from September 20, 1909 and Peterson to Kozhevnikov from July 4 and November 5, 1909.

53 Kozhevnikov V.A. On the Significance of Christian Asceticism in the Past and Present (Christian Reading. 1909. No. 8-9; separate edition: Part 1-2. Moscow, 1910).

54 Quote from the poem by V.A. Kozhevnikov "The Purpose of Life" (1898). Published: Russian Herald. 1898. No. 11-12 (republication: Fedorov. III, 728). In a poem written as a kind of response to Pushkin's "Life, why were you given to me?", Kozhevnikov wrote:

Life is given to us for victory

Over blind nature,

Which gives birth to illnesses, troubles,

Hunger, death in the human family.

Life is given to us for salvation

The lives of all earthly sons;

Life is given to revive

Our brothers and fathers.

55 Published according to: Seeking the City. P. 269.

56 In 1911, the magazine "Put" began publishing a series of monographs "Russian Thinkers". Monographs about A.S. Khomyakov, A.A. Kozlov, G.S. Skovoroda were published. Monographs about N.V. Gogol, F.M. Dostoevsky, K.I. Leontiev, N.S. Leskov, N.F. Fedorov and others were planned. Kozhevnikov's book about Fedorov was not republished in this series.

57 The brochure "Towards the cause of pacification, initiated by the note of August 12, 1898", consisting of two articles by Fedorov: "The 6th exhibition of the Voronezh provincial museum ..." and "A new painting - "Let all be one: as You, Father, are in Me ...", was published in Voronezh without indicating the author's name in the spring of 1899.

58 Fedorov, who attached special importance to the High Priestly Prayer of the Savior, seeing in it a call for perfect unity like the Trinity, believed that the depiction of this prayer should be introduced into the iconographic canon. He proposed his vision of the future icon or fresco, and in the summer of 1898 in Voronezh, the artist and icon painter L. G. Solovyov wrote a sketch of the icon-picture based on this project. Fedorov wrote about this sketch in the second article included in the brochure “Towards the cause of pacification…”, and also again outlined his vision of the icon-picture of the High Priestly Prayer. As can be concluded from S. M. Severov’s letter, he tried to encourage A. Ya. Sokol to paint such an icon-picture.

59 Published according to: GMT.

60 On June 29, 1910, the newspapers “Sovremennoye Slovo” and “Utro Rossii” published a letter from L. N. Tolstoy addressed to the Slavic Congress, which opened in Sofia on June 24. The letter raised the question of the foundations of human unity, with Tolstoy emphasizing that true unity is the unity of "all humanity in the name of a foundation common to all humanity," and such a foundation cannot be found in politics, economics, or culture, but only in religion. In his article "Can the Unity of People Be the Goal of Human Life?" (Turkestan Diocesan Gazette. September 15, 1910), Peterson, agreeing with Tolstoy's thought, interpreted it in the spirit of the teaching of the universal cause, emphasizing that economics, culture, and all private associations, be it a family, community, or state, can lead to perfect unity if the people who comprise them are imbued with a sense of religious duty. In doing so, he polemically touched upon the article by M. O. Menshikov “All or Nothing” (New Time. 1910. No. 12320. July 1 (14)), which emphasized that instead of unity in humanity, disunity grows and deepens with each passing year, and insisted on the strict fulfillment of “the will of God and nature” (Peterson rebelled against this confusion of God with the blind forces of nature in his article).

61 See note 161 to the correspondence between Kozhevnikov and Peterson.

62 Published according to: Tolstoy. 82, 179-180.

63 “God is love” (1 John 4:13). Speaking of love as the essence of deities, the Apostle John does not at all state that “love is God.”

64 Tolstoy expressed his request not to write to him anymore in a letter to Peterson dated September 14, 1909. This was done after receiving a letter from his student Fedorov dated September 1, 1909, in which, responding to the arrest of Tolstoy’s secretary N. N. Gusev, Peterson reproached the writer for the discrepancy between his preaching and his deeds, for not sharing his exile with Gusev. Tolstoy’s teaching was called in the letter “slander on true Christianity,” “playing into the hands of <…> revolutionaries” {Peterson, 115).

65 Letters from student Vs. Anichkov, a native of Verny, who studied at St. Petersburg University in the early 1910s, are published by: NIOR TRGB. F. 657. K. 6. Unit 23.

66 "Bibliography. Popular, encyclopedic, imaginary knowledge, and real knowledge; the transition from imaginary knowledge to real knowledge" // Philosophy of the common cause. I, 681-684; Fedorov. III, 230-233.

67 This is about the "Physics Course" (4 volumes, 1892-1915), which was developed by physicist Orest Danilovich Khvolson (1852-1934) and contributed to raising the level of teaching physics, remaining a model manual for higher education for a long time.

68 Published according to: NIOR RSL. F. 657. K. 6. Unit 24. About A.P. Barsukov, see: Pro et contra. Book 1. Page 1001, note 28.

69 A.P. Barsukov sent Peterson book 22 of N.P. Barsukov's multi-volume study "The Life and Works of M.P. Pogodin" (St. Petersburg, 1910).

70 Nikolai Aleksandrovich Demchinsky (1851-1915) - engineer, writer, actively involved in meteorology. From 1907 he was an active promoter of bed cropping.

71 Error or typo by Severov. A negative reaction to V.N. Karazin's project "On the Application of Electricity to Human Needs" was expressed not by A.A. Arakcheev, who was interested in his idea of ​​artificially causing rain, but by Academician N. Fuss (see: Fedorov. II, 261-262).

72 An earthquake in the Semirechye region with an epicenter in the city of Verny occurred on December 23, 1910. Telegrams about the incident were printed in Russian newspapers on the same day (see, for example: Novoye Vremya. 1910. No. 12495. December 23).

73 This refers to the parable of the workers in the vineyard.

74 Fedorov wrote about the custom of gratuitous aid, with the whole world, which existed in the peasant community, in the article “On the Significance of Everyday Churches” (Philosophy of the Common Cause. I, 689-694).

75 Rom 12:19.

76 See note 142 to the correspondence of Kozhevnikov and Peterson.

77 It was not possible to establish which notes S. M. Severov had in mind.

78 Berdyaev did not write a book about Fedorov.

79 See note 50. The note that M. N. Peterson is talking about appeared in issue 77 of the newspaper “Russkie Vedomosti” on April 5, 1911, in the section “Bibliographic Notes”.

80 Published according to: NIOR RSL. F. 657. K. 5. Unit 32. About K.P. Afonin See note 79 to the correspondence between Kozhevnikov and Peterson.

81 K.P. Afonin sent Peterson a photograph of a sketch by L.O. Pasternak, made from life in the 1890s. The sketch was reproduced in A.A. Ginken's article "The Ideal Librarian" (See note 50).

82 Ivan Ivanovich Alekseev (1885-1939) - engineer, local historian. He was born in the city of Bogorodsk (now Noginsk, Moscow Region), in 1910 he graduated from the Imperial Moscow Technical School, where he became interested in L. Tolstoy's teaching on non-resistance. Since the 1910s. began to take a serious interest in Fedorov's ideas. He corresponded with N.P. Peterson and communicated with his son M.N. Peterson. In the 1920s, he corresponded with M. Gorky, to whom he also wrote about Fedorov, and N.A. Setnitsky. Largely under the influence of Fedorov's ideas on national studies and the study of "local history", Alekseev's interest in local history arose, in which he did a lot. As his son, A.I. Alekseev, wrote, "he walked the entire Bogorodsky district and not only it, but also the entire Eastern Moscow region. Even before the revolution, my father published articles about historical and cultural monuments of the region in the Bogorodskaya Rech newspaper. In particular, he discovered a tombstone on the grave of Ya.V. Bryus by Martos in the area of ​​the Glinka estate. He collected information about the history of the construction and opening of the railway line to the city, about the Narodnaya Volya member T. I. Lebedeva, about the sailor Zheleznyak, about the partisans of 1812" (Bogorodsky Krai. 1997. No. 1. P. 76). He was the first bibliographer of literature on the Bogorodsky Uyezd. In 1922, on the initiative and with the direct participation of I. I. Alekseev, a scientific and pedagogical institute of local history was created in Bogorodsk. "The institute studied the economy, life, historical past and natural resources of the region, published a printed bulletin "Bogorodsky Krai" (8 issues were published in 1928)" (Ibid.). In 1925, he met K. E. Tsiolkovsky, corresponded with him until the scientist's death, in 1935, he began corresponding with R. Rolland. On February 18, 1938, he was arrested and executed on August 20, 1939.

Letters from I. I. Alekseev to N. P. Peterson are published by: NIOR RSL. F. 657. Op. 6. Unit 22. The Peterson archive contains drafts of two letters to Alekseev and a copy of an extensive letter dated December 24, 1911, in which he answers questions from his correspondent, which he placed on Fedorov's teaching.

83 See note 121 to the correspondence between Kozhevnikov and Peterson.

84 In the city of Bogorodsk in 1858-1864, N.F. Fedorov worked as a teacher of history and geography at the local district school.

85 In Bogorodsk, N.P. Peterson lived and worked as a teacher of arithmetic and geometry at the same school from mid-March 1864 to the first ten days of March 1865.

86 About Peterson's brochures See note 161 to the correspondence between Kozhevnikov and Peterson. Tolstoy's letter—Tolstoy's letter to Peterson dated October 5, 1910.

87 See note 172 to the correspondence between Kozhevnikov and Peterson.

88 The family of E.B.Pasternak and E.V.Pasternak has an oil sketch, apparently related to the aforementioned project of the portrait of Fedorov. However, the finished oil portrait is unknown. Two pastel portraits of the philosopher are known. One, completed by order of the Academic Collegium of the Rumyantsev Museum, dates back to 1919 and is kept in the Russian State Library, the other is in the family of E.B.Pasternak and E.V.Pasternak.

90 See note 178 to the correspondence of Kozhevnikov and Peterson.

91 I. I. Alekseev's article "In Blessed Memory of the Righteous Philosopher N. F. Fedorov" was published in issues 23-25 ​​of the newspaper "Bogorodskaya Rech" on July 17, 24 and 31, 1911. Alekseev focused his attention on the personality of the thinker, his ascetic way of life, his selfless care for his neighbors, wrote about him as a teacher and librarian, and emphasized his influence on Tolstoy, Dostoevsky and Solovyov. In doing so, he relied on both Kozhevnikov's book and his oral stories. Kozhevnikov told Alekseev that Fedorov "bought with his own money for the public library those books that were not in it. Wanting to encourage library employees to be more careful when putting books back on the shelves, N. F-ch paid two of them 3 rubles each. per month for the correct arrangement of books from his already meager salary" (Bogorodskaya Rech. 1911. No. 24. July 24). In the last part of the article, speaking about the difficulties of restoring the biography of the philosopher, Alekseev addressed an appeal to the residents of Bogorodsk: "if <…> people were found who remembered N. F-ch or studied with him", they "could fill the gap in the biography of the humble personality of the thinker with their memories and at least fulfill their duty in restoring the image of N. F-ch in the memory of people" (Ibid. No. 25. July 31).

92 I. I. Alekseev met D. P. Konisi (See note 40 to the correspondence of Kozhevnikov and Peterson) during the time of his passion for Tolstoyism. He corresponded with him. In 1914 he wrote an article “Different skies—one people (thoughts, meetings, memories)” about connections with Japanese Tolstoyans (see: Tolstaya. S. A. Diaries. Moscow, 1936. P. 298).

93 I. I. Alekseev is referring to a fragment of the story “Evening” by the Belgian poet and writer Georges Rodenbach (1855-1898), which was actively translated in Russia during the era of symbolism: Rodenbach J. Complete Works. Vol. II. M., 1910. Page 97.

94 Maria Konstantinovna (according to other sources, Stepanovna) Lebedeva, née Protopopova, was the wife of D.P. Lebedev, a historian and archivist, head of the Department of Manuscripts and Slavic Early Printed Books at the Rumyantsev Museum, and a friend and colleague of N.F. Fedorov. After the death of D.P. Lebedev, Fedorov maintained warm relations with his family, visiting his widow and children in Ryazan and Yegolniki. M. Lebedeva's letters to Fedorov are published in: Fedorov. IV, 640-642. Fedorov's letters to Lebedeva have not been found.

95 Job 42:17.

96 Philosopher and historian of philosophy Nikolai Yakovlevich Grot (1852-1899) introduced D.P. Konisi to L. Tolstoy in 1892. It can be assumed that he introduced him to Fedorov in the same year.

97 Published according to: Vzyskuyushchee Grada. P. 433.

98 This is about N.A. Berdyaev. Due to his conflict with the publishing house "Put", the monograph about Fedorov, announced in the publishing house's plans, was never written.

99 The aforementioned collection was planned by the publishing house "Put", however, due to the same conflict between "Put" and Berdyaev, it never took place (See below the letter of S.N. Bulgakov to V.F. Ern from March 19, 1912).

100 Fragments of the correspondence between V.A. Kozhevnikov and P.A. Florensky are published in: Questions of Philosophy. 1991. No. 6. Pp. 92-127. ,

101 Probably, this is about P.A. Florensky's candidate's thesis "On Religious Truth" (1908), which later formed the basis of his master's dissertation "On Spiritual Truth. An Experience of Orthodox Theodicy" (Moscow, 1913. Issues 1-2).

102 Archimandrite Serapion (Mashkin) (1854-1905) - church writer, religious thinker. P.A. Florensky met Fr. Serapion in the last year of his life, prepared for publication Fr. Serapion's philosophical WORK and a work on his life and work.

103 In a letter to Florensky dated March 14, 1912, Kozhevnikov complained about the piles of unfinished work. One of the reasons for this, in addition to personal life circumstances, work in the Circle of Seekers of Christian Enlightenment, was his collaboration with Fedorov, and then his occupation with his legacy: “Then Nik. Fed. Fedorov took me on his work; I did not protest; I helped him, wrote, translated ... N.F. died, bequeathing his manuscripts to me; sorting them out was slow and difficult; published the first volume of it; prepared the second, published my book about it; began the second part of it... All this took a fair amount of time" (Problems of Philosophy. 1991. No. 6. P. 95).

104 Published according to: Seeking the City. P. 457.

105 This is about N.A. Berdyaev.

100 Peterson's trip to Crimea, where Kozhevnikov lived in the summer, was planned for joint work on preparing the second volume of "Philosophy of the Common Cause".

107 This is about the Brotherhood of the Saints of Moscow (See note 276 to the correspondence of Kozhevnikov and Peterson).

108 Letters to Peterson from Dmitry Filippovich Popov, a history and geography teacher at the Penza Real School, are published according to: NIOR RGV. F. 657. K. 6. Unit 54.

112 At that time, E.N. Trubetskoy was working on the monograph “Worldview of Vl. S. Solovyov”.

113 D.F.Popov planned to see N.P.Peterson in Nizhny Lomov, where Nikolai Pavlovich, heading to the Crimea, was supposed to stop for a short time with his sister, E.P.Dobrotina. The meeting did not take place.

114 D.F.Popov's attempt to see Peterson in Voronezh also ended in vain.

115 M.N. Peterson cites the book by M.A. Novoselov "The Forgotten Path of Experiential Knowledge of God (in Connection with the Question of the Nature of the Orthodox Mission)" (Vyshny Volochok, 1902), which made up the first issue of the series "Religious and Philosophical Library" published by him.

119 Letters from V.N. Khomutsky to N.P. Peterson see in the anthology below.

120 This is about L. Tolstoy’s former secretary N.N. Gusev.

121 Published according to: Moscow archive of A.K. Gorsky and N.A. Setnitsky. The letter was written following a conversation between Nina Ivanovna Dorofeeva, the publisher of Brikhnichev's books, and N. N. Chernogubov about N. F. Fedorov. Dorofeeva's visit to Chernogubov was connected with the interest of I. P. Brikhnichev and A. K. Gorsky in Fedorov's ideas and their intention to publish the collection "Universal Deed".

122 A drawing of Fedorov's death mask was published in issue 1 of the magazine "Vesy", accompanying the publication of the fragment "On Letters", a portrait-sketch from life - in issue 2 together with the philosopher's article "Astronomy and Architecture". Photographs were taken for the editorial office of Vselenskoye Delo, and an image of the death mask was printed in the first issue of the collection,

123 For an authentic version of this statement by Fedorov, see the draft letter to Kozhevnikov from the end of March—beginning of April 1902 (Fedorov. IV, 462). The reason for it was Kozhevnikov’s work on “Essays on Modern Catholicism” (two chapters of the study “Political Claims and Hopes of Modern Catholicism” and “Political Catholicism in Germany” were published in the magazine “Russian Messenger” (1901. No. 12; 1902. No. 1).

124 It is surprising how Fedorov’s fear that Chernogubov would not fail to welcome him as an atheist was justified here. The convergence of Fedorov’s ideas with the systems of A. Schopenhauer and E. Hartmann, which he invariably criticized, is also incomprehensible, as is the following statement that Fedorov “recognized neither Orthodoxy nor autocracy.”

125 N. N. Chernogubov is mistaken—See note 1 to his memoirs about Fedorov (Pro et contra. Book 1. P. 1033). He distorts both the reasons and the time of his disagreement with V.A. Kozhevnikov, which actually occurred immediately after Fedorov's death, during the discussion of what to do with his manuscripts.

126 This concerns the widow of the poet A.K. Tolstoy, Sofya Andreyevna Tolstaya, and her niece Sofya Petrovna Khitrovo, with whom Solovyov became close in 1876-1877 upon his return from a trip to Egypt. Solovyov was in close correspondence with S.A. Tolstaya, and he deeply loved S.P. Khitrovo.

127 This concerns the Grand Duchess Elizaveta Feodorovna Romanova (1864-1918). After the murder of her husband (February 4, 1905), she dissolved the court and devoted herself to charity. In 1907, she founded the Martha and Mary Convent of Sisters of Mercy. On April 11, 1910, she took monastic vows and became the abbess of the convent. On her initiative, a hospital, an outpatient clinic, a pharmacy, a shelter for girls, and a free canteen for the poor were established in the convent.

128 This letter from I.P. Peterson to E.N. Trubetskoy opened the epistolary stage of their polemics regarding the relationship between V.S. Solovyov and N.F. Fedorov. The reason for the polemics was the publication in the pages of the same magazine (1912. No. 4) of Trubetskoy's article "Soloviev's Life Task and the Worldwide Crisis of Life-Understanding", which was a chapter from the book he was preparing "The Worldview of Vl. S. Solovyova" (Vol. 1-2. M., 1913), in which Trubetskoy set as his task the overcoming of utopias — “utopias of social reformism,” “national messianism,” “this-worldly transformation of the universe,” which, according to the author, constituted the Achilles heel of Solovyov’s worldview. In the chapter “Soloviev’s Life Task and the Worldwide Crisis of Life Understanding,” he sought to present the sources of Solovyov’s synthesis, driven by the desire to transform the question of the meaning of life from an abstract philosophical one into a religious and practical one, to directly connect it with the question of the meaning and task of history (in addition to Fedorov, Trubetskoy examined here German mysticism, the religious and philosophical views of the Slavophiles, Chaadayev, and Dostoevsky). In the chapter “Soloviev and Fedorov,” Trubetskoy attributed the religious and philosophical echoes of the two thinkers (the moral interpretation of the dogma of the Trinity, the concept of all-unity, the desire to “extend the ideal of the Kingdom of God to nature,” etc.) to the general Christian foundation of their worldview and emphasized that Soloviev’s main ideas were formed independently of Fedorov. Moreover, if “both thinkers agree in their understanding of the ultimate goal of universal resurrection,” then Fedorov’s thoughts “on the scientific paths and means of achieving this goal do not leave the slightest trace in Soloviev’s worldview” (Problems of Philosophy and Psychology. 1912. Book 4. Page 278).

Trubetskoy’s article provoked a polemical response from Peterson. His “Note on the Article of Prince E. Trubetskoy "Soloviev's Life Task and the Worldwide Crisis of Life-Understanding"" he sent to Trubetskoy himself with a request to publish this text in "Problems of Philosophy and Psychology". At the beginning of 1913, Trubetskoy informed Peterson about his agreement with L. M. Lopatin, editor of the journal "Problems of Philosophy and Psychology", that the note and his, Trubetskoy's, response to it would be published in the spring or fall (NIOR RSL. Fund 657. Collection 6. Unit 63. Sheet 5). And so it happened. Both texts, Peterson's article and Trubetskoy's response "A Few Words about Soloviev and Fedorov", were published in 1913 in issue No. 3 of the said journal in the "Controversy" section. In his article, Peterson focused his attention on Trubetskoy’s thesis that, while converging on religious goals, the thinkers diverged on the means. Referring to Soloviev’s letter to Fedorov dated January 12, 1882 (the exact date of the letter was not known at the time, and the thinker’s students dated the letter either to 1882 or to “the mid-eighties”—Kozhevnikov, 317), written under the impression of reading Fedorov’s manuscript, which set out not only the goal but also the means of the common cause, Peterson insisted that Soloviev accepted Fedorov’s project in its entirety: in his own words, “unconditionally and without any discussion.” “By declaring that it is necessary to talk about the first practical steps to implementing the project, Soloviev therefore acknowledges that the project he has accepted must and can be implemented in precisely the ways indicated in the manuscript, i.e., natural, scientific. From this it is evident that, at least immediately after reading the manuscript, Soloviev was also carried away by Fedorov’s realism” (Problems of Philosophy and Psychology. 1913. Book 3. P. 407). In addition, Fedorov’s student spoke about contacts between Soloviev and Fedorov in the first half of October 1891, shortly before Soloviev’s presentation of the paper “On the Causes of the Decline of the Medieval Worldview”: “Soloviev persuaded Nikolai Fyodorovich to compose an appeal for a common cause together, and he undertook to write down what Fedorov dictated to him,” a day was appointed for joint work, however, on that day Soloviev did not come, “but sent a letter in which he informed him that circumstances of a public nature prevented him from being with him” (Ibid. P. 409). In conclusion of the article, Peterson cited an extensive excerpt from Part III of the “Question of Brotherhood” (Fedorov. I, 146), where the discussion was about the justification of history, which was presented as a matter of “implementing the ‘Good News’” (“The Resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the universal resurrection, and subsequent history is its continuation”), and the regulation of nature was considered part of the Christian task of man in the world. Trubetskoy, in his response to Peterson, relying on the incorrect dating of Soloviev’s first letter to Fedorov, continued to insist that it was impossible “to speak of Fedorov’s influence” on Soloviev “earlier than the mid-eighties.” He conducted the conversation about Soloviev’s attitude to Fedorov against the ideological and philosophical background of the second, theocratic period, with the unshakable conviction that neither in the first, nor especially in the third period could there have been any influence of Fedorov on Soloviev. The philosopher categorically denied any possibility of the two thinkers being close in their approach to the problem of realizing the resurrection ideal. According to Trubetskoy, Fedorov intended to “resurrect the unglorified, spiritual body,” while Solovyov spoke of the resurrection of the “glorified, spiritual body.” As proof that Fedorov’s resurrection does not presuppose either a spiritual and bodily transformation of man or a radical change in the laws of nature, Trubetskoy cited quotes from Solovyov’s second letter to Fedorov (also incorrectly dated at that time to the middle of 1880s). According to Trubetskoy, Solovyov in his letter “points out to Fedorov that the divine-human work of resurrection should be understood not as a one-sided action of man, but as a joint, collective work of the perfect God and the perfect man” (Problems of Philosophy and Psychology. 1913. Book 3. pp. 418, 419). Interpreting Solovyov's letter in this way, Trubetskoy tendentiously reinterpreted Fedorov's notes in its margins and deliberately kept silent about Solovyov's phrase "You, of course, completely agree with this - this is your own thought," which clearly indicates that, in discussing the need to resurrect people "in the proper form," Solovyov not only did not argue with Fedorov, but simply recounted the philosopher of the universal cause's own assertions (for more details, see: Pro et contra. Book I. Pp. 574-578).

Peterson's letter of July 21, 1913 was a response to Trubetskoy's article "A Few Words about Solovyov and Fedorov." In clarifying the dates of Solovyov's letters to Fedorov, and reporting a number of unknown data on the history of their relationship, he devoted the main part of the letter to responding to Trubetskoy's critical remarks about the resurrection project. However, in responding to the main and highly unfair reproach of his opponent—that Fedorov's immanent resurrection does without the transformation of the physical nature of man—he allowed himself highly arbitrary judgments that find no support in the philosopher's texts. Instead of pointing out the obvious aberrations in his opponent's philippic and demonstrating with specific examples how important for Fedorov in the resurrection process was precisely the moment of transformation of both the spiritual and physical composition of man and the world as a whole, Peterson indulged in arbitrary fantasies. According to him, Fedorov supposedly believed that the dead are resurrected in their former bodies, but then, with the help of their descendants who have achieved the fullness of deification, transform their flesh into a “spiritual body.”

Such an interpretation, of course, could not satisfy Trubetskoy and only exacerbated his prejudice against Fedorov’s ideas, causing a letter from July 28, in which the author of the monograph on Soloviev reproaches Peterson, and then Fedorov, for not recognizing the ideal of the “new creature” (about the fact that in fact Trubetskoy’s position on the question of resurrection did not contradict Fedorov’s position, See note 230 to the correspondence between Kozhevnikov and Peterson).

Peterson intended the letter from July 21, 1913 for publication, but it was not possible to publish it in the journal “Problems of Philosophy and Psychology.” In January 1914, the letter was sent to P.A. Florensky with a request to publish it in the journal "Theological Herald" (See below Peterson's letter to Florensky). Then, on Florensky's advice, Peterson reworked it into an article "On the article of Prince E.N. Trubetskoy "A Few Words about Soloviev and Fedorov"" and sent it again to "Theological Herald". However, the article was never published (the original was preserved in the Moscow archive of A.K. Gorsky and N.A. Setnitsky). Later, Peterson made a number of attempts to publish the article, which invariably ended in failure.

The text of the letter is printed from a copy by Yu.V. Peterson: NIOR RSL. F. 657. K. 6. Ed. h. 18.

129 While reworking the letter to E.N. Trubetskoy into an article, Peterson corrected this incorrect dating: “...at the present time a letter dated January 12, 1882 has been found [this refers to Fedorov’s letter to Peterson—Fedorov. IV, 216], from which it is evident that on that day, i.e. January 12, Soloviev returned the manuscript to N. F-chu, after reading which Soloviev addressed N. F-chus with a letter, published in the book by V.A. Kozhevnikov, under the title “Nikolai Fedorovich Fedorov”, pp. 317-318, in which Soloviev calls Fedorov his teacher and recognizes Fedorov’s teaching as “the first movement of the human spirit along the path of Christ since the appearance of Christ” (Peterson N.P. Regarding the article by Prince E.N. Trubetskoy “A Few Words about Soloviev and Fedorov” // Moscow Archive of A.K. Gorsky and N.A. Setnitsky).

130 Quote from a draft letter from Fedorov to N.A. Engelhardt (Fedorov. IV, 389).

131 See note 215 to the correspondence between Kozhevnikov and Peterson. This episode is also cited in Peterson's letter to Kozhevnikov dated December 24, 1897 (Fedorov. IV, 610).

132 What Peterson calls a letter is a note "What to call the year when in the middle of summer they sang Easter, fulfilling the prophecy of Seraphim?" (Fedorov. IV, 165).

133 On the meaning of this phrase in Fedorov and the inseparable connection in his system of ideas of resurrection and transformation See below in the article by S.G. Semenova and A.G. Gacheva "N.F. Fedorov and the Myths about Him". As it turns out from Fedorov’s articles and notes on Soloviev, included in Volume II and intended for Volume III of “The Philosophy of the Common Cause,” Fedorov was even more radical than Soloviev on the issue of transformation (see the introductory article to the anthology, as well as Fedorov. II, 138; IV, 81-82).

134 Peterson’s interpretation of Fedorov’s idea of ​​the resurrection process is incorrect and does not correspond to the thinker’s texts. See note 133.

138 Quote from Peterson’s draft letter to Kozhevnikov, written after May 8, 1902 (Fedorov. IV, 464).

139 In the beginning of the letter, omitted from this publication, Peterson, in particular, testified that Solovyov’s 2nd letter to Fedorov was written, in all likelihood, in the summer of 1882, when Solovyov “was planning to come to his friend Prince D.N. Tsertelev, in Lipyagi, Spassky district, Tambov province, thirty versts from the city of Kerensk, where I lived, and where N.F. Fedorov was staying with me. Solovyov wanted to visit us in Kerensk from Lipyagi” (ЫИОР РГБ. F. 657. К. 6. Item 18).

156 Mikhail Nikolaevich - M.N. Peterson.

157 Letters from V.N. Khomutsky to N. II. Peterson and his article "The Call of Life" are published according to: NIOR RSL. F. 657. K. 6. Kd. hr. 72. Vasily Nikolaevich Khomutsky (Khamutsky, Khomutsky) - a peasant from the village of Pekhlets in the Ryazan province, a former Tolstoyan. After becoming acquainted with the ideas of Fedorov, he renounced Tolstoyism. His name is found in the correspondence between Kozhevnikov and Peterson and in letters to Peterson from D.F. Popov. Thus, the latter wrote to Peterson at the end of January: “The peasant’s address: Ryazan-Uralsk railway station. Korablino-Pekhletsky peasant Vasily Nikolaevich Khomutsky: I saw him at Christmas, he also found a comrade who fully understood N.F. Fedorov and is now studying him...” (NIORRGB. F. 657. K. b. Ed. hr. 54. L. 14). As Kozhevnikov reported to Peterson, Khomutsky visited him in Moscow in September 1913, and Vladimir Alexandrovich advised him to write how he came to Fedorov (see Kozhevnikov's letter to Peterson dated October 10, 1913). The article "The Call of Life" was the fulfillment of this advice. In it, the voice of those "uneducated" people, people of the peasant, agricultural class, to whom, according to Fedorov, the idea of ​​a common cause should be clear first of all, is heard.

158 V.A. Kozhevnikov and N.P. Peterson.

159 In his article, Khomutsky relies on Part IV of the “Question of Brotherhood…”, where the image of an ideal community of a common cause is presented, which has embarked on the path of regulating nature and resurrection and therefore was able to provide a real solution to the food problem: “Hunger and death come from the same causes, and therefore the question of resurrection is also a question of liberation from hunger. In order to be provided from hunger, a person must know himself and the world so well as to be able to produce himself from the most basic principles into which every human being is decomposed; and through this he will not only acquire the opportunity, but will also become a necessity to reproduce all deceased beings” (Philosophy of the Common Cause. I, 276-277; Fedorov. I, 250).

160 “The Sanitary Question” is one of the fragments of Part IV of the “Question of Brotherhood…” (Philosophy of the Common Cause. I, 276-2 81; Fedorov. I, 249-253).

161 A draft of a letter from V.A. Kozhevnikov to I.P. Brikhnichev refusing to collaborate in the collection “Vselenskoe Delo” is published according to: NIOR RSL. F. 657. K. 6. Unit of storage. 43. L. 52-52 rev. Above the text, in pencil, Kozhevnikov wrote: “Given to him by M.N. Peterson personally in Moscow on December 2, 1913. A copy of the same date was sent to A.K. Gorsky in Odessa.”

162 This refers to I.P. Brikhnichev’s collection of sermons “The Fiery Sower” (Moscow, 1913) and his poetry collection “A Drop of Blood” (Moscow, 1912).

163 In the introduction to the collection “The Fiery Sower,” I.P. Brikhnichev cast harsh reproaches at the world that had distorted the covenants of Christ. The Lord comes with the sermon “let all be one,” while people, in the person of those in power, throw others “out to hunger and need, spread slander, and tear the ground from under their feet.” Nineteen centuries ago, they exchanged Barabbas, “closer” to them “in spirit,” for Him, and to Him, who brought “Life and Light,” they offered a cross and nails, thorns and a bite mixed with bile.” “But you have forgotten. ‘My lords, I have come to tell you the news.’ Besides you, there is also the World of God, and whether you want it or not, you are responsible for everything and everyone” (Brikhnichev I.P. The Fiery Sower. Moscow, 1913. Pp. 5-6).

164 This is about the collection “The Universal Cause”.

165 A quote from a letter from N.N. Strakhov to L.N. Tolstoy dated February 5, 1892. The article by V.V. Rozanov (New Time. 1913. No. 13544. November 24; No. 13548. November 28), in which it was cited, was based on an analysis of the correspondence of the philosopher and writer.

168 In issue 12 of the “Theological Herald” for 1913, a review by S.A. Golovanenko of Volumes I–II of “The Philosophy of the Common Cause” was published.

169 Following the review of "The Philosophy of the Common Cause" in the same issue of "Theological Herald" there was a review by S. A. Golovanenko of the book by S. N. Bulgakov "The Philosophy of Economy", in analyzing which, the reviewer pointed out the kinship of the positions of Fedorov and Bulgakov: both strive to resolve the issue of "the relationship between the Heavenly Church (the Trinity as a dogma-commandment) and the Earthly Church (the Trinity as the fulfillment of the commandment)", both are attentive to the problem of economy, religiously comprehend the problem of human labor in the world. At the same time, if Fedorov speaks of the resurrection of fathers and ancestors, then Bulgakov pays primary attention to the problem of the resurrection of all nature. The next review, authored by N. M. Solovyov, "A Few Words about the 'Philosophizings' of Prof. Mechnikov", was devoted to a critical analysis of Mechnikov's book "Forty Years of Searching for a Rational Worldview", and above all his attitude to death, in which the scientist saw the absolute end of each personality, but at the same time believed that in old age the fear of death disappears in a person, and, on the contrary, even a natural desire for it arises. Against Mechnikov's ideas, N. M. Soloviev put forward the Resurrection of Christ and cited a quote from Soloviev's article "Christ is Risen!"

170 Letters from a student of the St. Petersburg Theological Academy Mikhail Mikhailovich Krotkov to N. P. Peterson are published by: NIOR RSL. F. 657. K. 6. Unit of storage. 45.

171 Peterson sent Kozhevnikov's book about Fedorov to M. M. Krotkov.

174 N.P. Peterson suggested that M.M. Krotkov send a copy of his letter to E.N. Trubetskoy dated July 21, 1913, in which he polemicized with the philosopher's article "A Few Words about Solovyov and Fedorov (Response to N.P. Peterson)".

175 See note 168.

176 By the way (lat.).

177 In his review of Volume I of The Philosophy of the Common Cause, S. A. Golovanenko brought to the forefront the epistemological aspect of the teaching of the common cause, pointing to Fedorov’s striving for “vital knowledge,” to the immanentism and projectivism of his thought, for which word and deed, subject and object are inseparable, to the connection in his work of epistemology with ontology: “Fedorov has a philosophy of the common cause, and not of general concepts; since thought is a project of the cause, it is a philosophy of practical concepts that clearly radiate their ontological light. In Fedorov’s philosophy, the epistemological grows out of the ontological, grows directly and freely.” Further, as a result of a critical analysis of a number of provisions of the doctrine of the universal cause, S. A. Golovanenko came to the strange conclusion that Fedorov equated resurrection and knowledge (in the words of the reviewer, "in knowledge is the very resurrection, the very essence of life and death") and, consequently, his "struggle with rationalism" turned into "refined gnosticism" (Theological Bulletin. 1913. No. 12. P. 842).

178 We are talking about the 1st issue of the collection "Universal Cause". I. P. Brikhnichev was one of its compilers and editors.

179 The correspondence of P. A. Florensky and N. P. Peterson is published according to: NIOR RSL. F. 657. L. 6. Ed. h. 71.

180 Peterson sent Florensky objection to the review by S. A. Golovanenko (See note 168).

181 This refers to the article by N. P. Peterson, “Note on the article by Prince E. Trubetskoy — “Soloviev’s life task and the global crisis of life understanding”…” and the response article by E. N. Trubetskoy, “A few words about Soloviev and Fedorov”, published in issue 3 of “Problems of Philosophy and Psychology” for 1913.

182 This refers to Peterson’s letter to E. N. Trubetskoy dated July 21, 1913.

183 The text of the “Confession of Faith Recognizing Resurrection with the Participation of Man Himself” has been preserved in the archive of N. P. Peterson (IIOR RSL. F. 657. K. 1. Unit 5). We cite fragments of this text:

“<…> Christ descended to earth for the sake of our salvation and, it seems, there can be no dispute that Christ came to save us precisely from the consequences of sin, redeemed by His suffering and death, from the consequences of sin, that is, from death, and from not only spiritual death, but also bodily death, for Christ was resurrected in human flesh and raised our flesh to the right hand of the heavenly Father. To explain the salvation for which Christ came in any spiritual way would be to belittle Christ’s work, to turn Christianity into an illusion. — The question is, why has salvation not yet been accomplished, and how can and should our salvation from death be accomplished?

Only God, our Creator, can save us, but this salvation can be accomplished in two ways: either without our participation in our own salvation, without our participation in the actual work of salvation, or with our participation in it, in the work of salvation.

We are not speaking of such participation as consists in doing the truth, in fulfilling only the rules of morality, for which salvation is granted, and not created by us ourselves, we are speaking of participation in the very arrangement of our salvation, in fact, the arrangement of our body, so that it becomes an immortal bearer of the immortal spirit, and in the matter of recreating the bodies of the dead, so that they become immortal dwellings of immortal souls. Until now, our body has been “an unconscious product of our vices,” as it is said on page 61 of volume 1 of the “Philosophy of the Common Cause,” but “our body must be our work, but not an egoistic self-arrangement, but a work through the return of life to the fathers who are being arranged.” <…>

If the Lord wanted to save us without our participation in it, then why would He have come down to earth, taken on human flesh, suffered, died? And without all this He could have granted us immortality, or all, or only some of those pleasing to Him (Acts X, 35), and also resurrected those worthy of it. But in this case we would forever remain powerless creatures, despicable beings. But if the Lord had honored us with His coming, taken on our flesh, subjected Himself to suffering and accepted death itself, it becomes obvious that a different fate is prepared for us, the Lord does not want us to remain creatures, slaves forever - by His coming, death and resurrection He showed us the possibility of becoming sons of God from creatures.

<…> To take upon ourselves the labor of studying those forces on which life and death depend - the labor of controlling these forces. This is impossible for each one individually, but it is accessible, we must assume, to the agreement of all people, of the whole human race, united in God in fulfillment of the prayer of Our Lord Jesus Christ: “That they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, that they also may be one in Us” (John XVII, 21). With such unity of all, with the unity of the whole human race in God, can there be anything inaccessible to our power?!.. The Savior called us to unite in the work of the general resurrection, having laid the foundation for this at the Last Supper, for, as it is said on page 133 of volume 1 of the “Philosophy of the Common Cause”, “Christianity is the unification of the living for the resurrection of the dead, i.e. the unification in love of those who eat and drink in order to return to the table of love of the departed; then they eat and drink in order to have the power to return the dead to life. Christ, having combined at his departure the remembrance or love for Himself (which means for all the departed) with food, with that which gives life and strength for work, commanded to gather all the living to this supper of love, love for Him, as for all the dead, such love that gives all the strength of life in order to see and hear Him, Our Savior, with all the departed." <…>

After the ascension of Christ - Our Savior, the apostles and disciples of His could only bear witness to Him, to His resurrection and thereby introduce the believers to the meal of love, uniting, strengthening in consubstantiality with Our Savior our brotherly union in Christ, mysteriously introducing the believers to eternal life, for which the apostles received the gift of the Holy Spirit. This explains why the first Christian community placed all its work only in preaching the Gospel, i.e. in calling for the work of salvation, but could not begin to implement it, the work of salvation itself, due to the enormity of this work, which required enormous forces, which did not yet exist, and there was no proper knowledge to develop the means, methods for implementing the great work of universal resurrection. Remembering, however, the words of the Lord Christ our Savior, that He is the truth, the way and life, our Holy Orthodox Church identified its service with the Passover of suffering and the Passover of Resurrection, in which the service of our Savior Lord Jesus Christ Himself was expressed, and in Holy Week, inextricably linked with Easter Week, the Orthodox Church outlined “a complete moral code, i.e. a plan or project, of the resurrection, repeating it in an abbreviated form in the other fifty weeks, especially in the weeks of the two Triodions, Lenten and Pentecostarion, which have profound moral and educational significance <…> The fifty-fold repetition of the rite in a threefold manifestation (dogmatic, ethical and aesthetic), i.e. the experience of all the virtues: repentance for every impure thought (Great Wednesday is the day of the repentant harlot, “who took on the rank of the myrrh-bearer”), brotherhood at the memorial meal (Maundy Thursday), compassion (Maundy Friday), co-dying (Maundy Saturday) and finally, co-rejoicing in the resurrection (Great Day) - all this has a pedagogical goal - to transform the old man into a son of man, and you have also into a son of God ... " But all this turns out to be powerless so far, powerless to transform our very life in all its manifestations <...>

What is needed so that this great instrument, i.e. multiple liturgical repetition, would have a beneficial effect on us, would unite us not only in the temple service, but also in life? Unification will obviously take place only when the goal is recognized, and recognized indisputably, when it is established what people are called to, not each one separately, but all together, when it is established what our common task is, and moreover, such a task that is capable of capturing our entire life, not limiting itself only to church service, such a task that is capable of turning all our extra-church activity, all extra-church reality, to its service. If there were not one common calling for all, a task accessible only to the common labor of all, then why would there be a need for unification of people? The unity in Christ established by the Church presupposes precisely one common task for all, equally dear and beloved by all, requiring the united efforts of all. <…>

<…> Christianity must capture the entire life of people, penetrate all the functions in which life is manifested, and science and art must be the means of realizing Christianity. Christ indicates the goal—salvation from death, and science must seek the means of salvation, while art must find ways and means to apply the means indicated by science to the cause of salvation from death and all the evils associated with death and leading to it. Having thus come from death to life, having recreated our bodies and recreated, having resurrected the dead, i.e. having passed from death to life, we will not come to judgment, according to the word of Our Savior (John V, 24)."

185 This refers to a series of articles by S. A. Golovanenko on Fedorov's teaching, the publication of which began with the April issue of the Theological Herald for 1914.

186 In a review of The Philosophy of the Common Cause, S. A. Golovanenko accused the philosopher of magic and asserted that in Fedorov's teaching, "along with the belittling of the idea of ​​salvation, resurrection, Christian hope is removed" (Theological Herald. 1913. No. 12. P. 840).

196 The collection “Universal Cause” included Bryusov’s response to the editorial questionnaire under the title “On Death, Resurrection, and Resurrection” (see below in this anthology).

197 About the article by Doctor of Medicine V.K. Nedzvetsky “Metampsychosis”, included in the collection “Universal Cause” in the section “Appendices” (pp. 31–42, second pagination) against the idea of ​​transmigration of souls, the idea of ​​a personality that, standing on the crest of a family, carries within itself “several individualities”, ancestors who left their mark on it, was put forward.

198 In the collection “Universal Cause” (pp. 140–207), under the pseudonym “R. Mannovsky”, the first part of Gorsky’s work “Earthly Craving” about the vital and ideological relationships of V.S. Solovyov and N.F. Fedorov was included.

Ivanov's article "On the Boundaries of Art", which was a report at the Moscow Religious-Philosophical Society and a public lecture in St. Petersburg (1913), was published: Trudy i dni. 1913. No. 7. Further, Gorsky refers to the polemics of V. Ya. Vryusov with Vyach. . Ivanov and A. Blok on the issue of symbolism: Bryusov's article "On slavish 'speech' in defense of poetry" (Apollo. 1910. No. 9), which insisted on seeing symbolism as a method of art, and not as a tool of theurgy, was directed against Vyach. Ivanov's articles "The Testaments of Symbolism" and A. Blok's "On the Current State of Russian Symbolism" (both: Apollon. 1910. No. 8).

201 See note. 249 to the correspondence between Kozhevnikov and Peterson.

202 In addition to his response to Trubetskoy (See note 174), Peterson sent Krotkov his article regarding S. A. Golovanenko's review of "The Philosophy of the Common Cause" and Fedorov's note "What to call the year when in the middle of summer they sang Easter, fulfilling the prophecy of Seraphim..." (published: Fedorov. IV, 165-168).

203 This refers to issue 12 of the journal "Bulletins of Literature and Life" (February 1914), in which Peterson's article "The Idea of ​​​​Universal Salvation from Death" appeared. Krotkov received it from Peterson in late March - early April 1914.

204 Philosophy of the Common Cause. II, 8; Fedorov. II, 44.

205 On March 15, 1914, Peterson sent Rozanov the manuscript of his article “On the Article of Prince E.N. Trubetskoy “A Few Words about Soloviev and Fedorov”” with a request to publish it in Novoye Vremya, if possible. The article was not published, and Peterson learned from S. M. Severov that Rozanov, in a telephone conversation with him, said about this article that “the article is too great for Novoye Vremya and that Novoye Vremya cannot become a missionary of Fedorov’s ideas.” Then on June 7, 1914, he wrote to Rozanov a second time, and the tone of his letter was bitter and harsh: “Your fear that Novoye Vremya might be considered a missionary of Fedorov’s ideas is completely incomprehensible to me—can the publication of one article, which, moreover, contains rather important biographical information about a person like V. S. Solovyov <…> can the publication of such an article be called missionary work?!.. And wouldn’t a refusal to publish the article be gagging the mouth of the speaker, something that is not desirable for those who have taken the keys of understanding into their own hands?!..

Now I am finally convinced that you are not only antipathetic, like Tolstoy, but perhaps even very repelled by the “religion of deeds,” which is the subject of all of Fedorov’s works—a truly Orthodox religion. For all our writers, “these foreigners writing about Russia,” as Fedorov calls them, only the religion of feeling, which finds its extreme expression in American revivals, is accessible and understandable, while the religion of action, the religion, I repeat, truly Orthodox, which was once expressed, at moments of the highest upsurges, in the construction of ordinary churches, now completely forgotten,” is alien to them (RGALI. F. 419. Op. 1. Ed. hr. 569. L. 10 rev. -11). In response to this letter, Rozanov wrote to Peterson (this letter has not survived, further Peterson partly touches on its content).

206 See: Pro et contra. Book 1. P. 143.

207 This refers to the journal “Problems of Philosophy and Psychology,” where the polemic between Trubetskoy and Peterson was published.

IV, 123-127). The reason for the appeal was the controversy between A.A. Kireev and S.N. Trubetskoy on the issue of Slavophilism, which took place in 1895. The text of Fedorov's draft letter to Kireev has also been preserved (Fedorov. IV, 291-193).

219 So in the original.

220 This refers to the article by N.P. Peterson “The Christianity of N.F. Fedorov, the Author of the Philosophy of the Common Cause” (for the history of its creation, see Kozhevnikov’s letter to Peterson dated April 2, 1915 and Peterson’s letters to Kozhevnikov dated April 8 and May 10, 1915 and the comments to these letters). The article was sent to Florensky on May 4, 1915.

221 This refers to the article by S. A. Golovanenko, “On the nature of the religious teaching of N. F. Fedorov (Response to N. P. Peterson),” dedicated to Peterson’s brochure, “On the religious nature of the teaching of N. F. Fedorov” (Moscow, 1915). The article was not published. Its manuscript is currently kept in Golovanenko’s personal collection at the Research Institute of Historical and Cultural Studies of the Russian State Library (F. 582, Cart. 2, Unit 4, Sheets 23–50).

222 See note 292 to the correspondence between Kozhevnikov and Peterson.

223 This refers to N. A. Berdyaev’s article, “Pror N.F. Fedorov's testimony about the war" (Birzhevye Vedomosti. 1915. No. 15027. 15 authors).

224 See note 94 to the correspondence of Kozhevnikov and Peterson.

225 N.F. Fedorov's testimony on the case of D.V. Karakozov has now been discovered in TsIAM by Bogorodsk regional historian A.N. Maslov. N.P. Peterson's testimony is stored in GARF (F. 272. List 1. Unit 21).

226 Published according to: NIOR RSL. F. 657. K. 6. Unit 59. L. 1-2 ob. N. S. Sozontov was an engineer, a native of Verny, where he met N. P. Peterson, who interested him in Fedorov's ideas.

227 The Peterson collection contains a typescript of an article by N. S. Sozontov, intended for sending to the newspapers Novoye Vremya and Russkoye Slovo: "Measures to combat flooding and river inundation, and soil depletion" (Ibid. L. 5-5 rev.). Pointing out that the cause of flooding is the snow melting in the spring, Sozontov proposed collecting this snow and, covering it with earth and garbage, creating artificial glaciers. In this way, he emphasized, it would be possible to prevent the rapid and simultaneous melting of snow: the snow would melt gradually, during the spring and part of the summer, the moisture would seep into the soil and moisten it. In addition, the construction of artificial glaciers will prevent the leaching of useful substances from the soil.

228 On April 28, 1917, N. S. Sozontov sent Peterson his work "Cultural and Economic Issues" (Ibid. L. 6-21), which proposed a number of measures to combat anhydrous conditions, floods and the opening of rivers, cyclones, and prevent deforestation. The central place in the work was occupied by the problem of creating artificial glaciers. N. S. Sozontov described in detail the technology of their creation, pointed out the importance of snow storage facilities in irrigation, flood prevention, the fight against loose sands and forest fires, and saw the creation of artificial glaciers as one of the steps towards future climate regulation. In the introduction to the work, Sozontov wrote: "Unfortunately, people have not yet become imbued with a conscious interest in natural phenomena; they look upon many of them as elemental forces that are not amenable to rational influence, while at the same time they already have enough examples of the use of natural forces. <…> It is a pity that the unlimited reason and omnipotent energy of people come to work only under the merciless blows of those laws of nature that should be in their hands a weapon against its harmful forces. Although man calls himself “the king of nature,” he, her miserable slave, suffers deprivations from all her whims and falls lifeless only from the electricity discharged above him” (Ibid. L. 7ob.).

229 In the commentary to the publication of this text in “Problems of Philosophy,” an interesting assumption was made: “This note by Florensky, in fact, is not a letter. It is a record of scanty biographical information about N.F. Fedorov. In a letter dated July 31, 1916, Kozhevnikov wrote that he was “glad to meet <…> sympathy” from Florensky in compiling Fedorov’s biography. Probably, Florensky not only “sympathized,” but also wanted to take part in this matter” (Problems of Philosophy. 1991. No. 6. P. 149).

230 As follows from other sources, Fedorov’s older brother, Alexander Fyodorovich Fedorov (1828-1897), served as a sworn attorney in St. Petersburg.

231 Letter to N.P. Peterson from publicist A.A. Moshchansky, author of the article “Thoughts and Predictions of N.F. Fedorov” (Russkaya Mysl. 1914. No. 12), published by: NIOR RSL. F. 657. K. 6. Unit 76. L. 1-3.

232 0 It has not been established which article of Peterson is being referred to.

233 This article by Moshchansky about Fedorov is unknown.

234 A draft letter from Peterson to P.A.Sergeenko (See note 121 to the correspondence between Kozhevnikov and Peterson) is published according to: NIOR RSL. F. 657. K. 1. Unit 32. L. 4 rev.

235 About A.L.Volynsky and his interest in Fedorov's ideas, see: Pro et contra. Book 1. Pp. 1065-1069.

236 This is about P.A. Sergeenko, see above the letter to him from Peterson, dated summer 1917.

237 From this reference it follows that Peterson managed to publish his objection to S.N. Bulgakov's article "The "Project" of Resurrection in the Teaching of I.F. Fedorov" as a separate brochure (See note 304 to the correspondence between Kozhevnikov and Peterson). However, this brochure has not yet been found in Russian libraries.

238 V.A. Kozhevnikov kept Fedorov's manuscripts in the safe of the Merchant Bank. Apparently, Peterson was going to take from A.V. Kozhevnikova all of Fedorov's remaining papers, but this was not done, and Fedorov's archive perished along with Kozhevnikov's archive.

239 The intention to publish Volume III of the "Philosophy of the Common Cause" in Petrograd was not realized.

240 This is about Fedorov's article "The Antinomy of Egoism and Altruism..." (See note 1 to Kozhevnikov's letter about the last hours of Fedorov's life // Pro et contra. Book 1. Page 981).

241 Published according to: RGALI. F. 95. Op. 1. Unit of storage. 1073. Patriarch Tikhon (Belavin) (1865-1925) - Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia (since 1917). Elected by the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church. A copy of Peterson's address to the patriarch has been preserved in the A.L. Volynsky collection, a draft of the address is in Peterson's personal collection in the Research Institute of Historical and Cultural Studies of the Russian State Library. On April 19, 1918, Peterson wrote to M.N. Peterson in Moscow: “I am sending you, “My dear friend, a copy of the letter to the Patriarch, which I sent on April 2, i.e. seventeen days ago, but have not received any response to this letter. I am also sending two copies of the note “What is Orthodoxy?”, as well as an article in the newspaper “Ashabat”, which is attached to the Patriarch’s letter under the title “On Freedom of Conscience”. I am also enclosing the article “What is Freedom of Conscience”, about which the article “On Freedom of Conscience” was written. Show all this to Ostroumov, will he agree to print all this in the “Missionary Collection”, and reprint the attached printed articles” (NIOR RSL. Fund 657. Coll. 5. Unit of storage 29. Sheet 7).

242 Both articles belonged to N.P. Peterson. The first one is preserved in the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art in the A. L. Volynsky collection, the second one is in Peterson's personal collection in the Research Institute of Historical and Cultural Studies of the Russian State Library.

243 This is about the article by G. P. Georgievskiy "From the Memories of Nikolai Fyodorovich (On the 40th Day of His Death)" (Moskovskie Vedomosti. 1904. 23-26 January).

244 A quote from Fedorov's article "The Project for the Unification of Churches", the second part of which contains an analysis of V. S. Solovyov's essay.

245 The article "On Freedom of Conscience" (Askhabad. 1902. No. 8. 8 January), published as part of the "Askhabad Controversy" (see Fedorov. Dop., 165-175), was written not by Fedorov, but by Peterson himself.

246 1 Cor 1:19.

247 This article belonged to N.P. Peterson.

248 N.P. Peterson's article "What is Orthodoxy" (without ending) has been preserved in the personal collection of A.L. Volynsky in the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art (F. 95. Op. 1. Unit 1018).

On pages 413-414 of Prince Trubetskoy's reply to me it says: "I had to talk with Solovyov about Fedorov more than once, starting from the second half of the eighties. I remember well that he spoke with the greatest sympathy about the goal set by Fedorov, but at the same time he was very skeptical about his natural-scientific methods of resurrecting the dead. L. M. Lopatin, to whom I refer with his permission, told me that Solovyov even laughed at these "natural-scientific methods" (of course, as at the eccentricities of a person he loved and respected)." On page 419 of the above-quoted article it says: “It is clear that no scientific inventions can glorify the human body with divine glory…” “Is it not clear that no scientific efforts can bring Christ down from heaven…”
The Apostle Paul is discussed in the first article of my book — “N. F. Fedorov and his book “The Philosophy of the Common Cause” in opposition to Tolstoy’s teaching “on non-resistance” — and other ideas of our time”143.
