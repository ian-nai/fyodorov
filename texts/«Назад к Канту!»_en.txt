Paulsen and other current German philosophers, sharing Kant's superstitions, called by him “critics,” cannot be critical of him and critically. It seems to them that Kant's main thoughts "should indicate the path to the modern worldview." Of course, it is not surprising that scientific Germany is unable to understand the unnaturalness and immorality of the “two minds”, and precisely because it, Germany, seems completely natural to the existence of two classes: scientists and unlearned. Reason, cognition became a specialty, created a special workshop; Cognition is no longer considered a necessary belonging to everyone and everyone, an all -human property. Having limited, narrowing the practical mind. Kant gives him primacy, which, of course, does not exalt him, does not expand his limits, as well as popular universities and generally popularization (do not expand the fields of knowledge). Criticism, believing the limits of the theoretical mind and the conceivable in general, did not require the expansion of the practical mind, that is, the expansion of the matter, the work, of course, is in common - the appeal of the blindness of nature in the controlled mind, which should consist of the most natural task of the practical mind.

Paulsen wants to prove that Kant is not an enemy of metaphysics, that he is much more metaphysic than a critic. With the help of metaphysics, Paulsen hopes to defeat modern rough realism and the current deepest faith due to money. But the contemporary artificial, factory realism may not be defeated by imaginary wisdom, metaphysicism, but only by natural realism, regulation, which will give each village strength for (temporary) artisanal work and thereby deprive the city factory of hands and generally kill money, because there will be no need for them. They will be handed over to museums and compile a subject of study not political and economic science, but historical-numismatics.
