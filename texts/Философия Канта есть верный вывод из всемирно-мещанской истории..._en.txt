Kant's philosophy is the right conclusion from the World-School history in general and the German-Roman history of the 18th century in particular. And if there is no other, wider and more substantial world-proper story, then there will also be also another philosophy, which, however, should be, that is, the philosophy of the common cause, as the 19th century proved, which returned after all his wandering to Kant, that is, to the denial of the truth (absolute) under the guise of humility of the truth itself and the good itself. A philosophy, emerging from criticism of pure reason, could only become what it became and what it abides and hitherto, that is, only thinking. But all philosophy and every philosophy is untenable if it is a thought idle. True philosophy distracted by false, lifeless philosophy turns into visible, tactile. But such a transformation of a conceivable into the implemented, in real, is the business of all people without exception, and not one scientific class. This is a real, moral and religious matter.
