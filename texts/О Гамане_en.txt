In Hamann lies the root of the trend with which we are forced, or rather, voluntarily must fight at the present time in order to acquire originality of thought, in order to free ourselves from the mental yoke created by imitation and assimilation of philosophical principles alien to the Russian soul. In order to successfully fight this trend, it is necessary to uncover its root, in which the philosophical sequel, its flower and fruit, is embryonically given, for in Hamann is already contained Hartmann, that Hartmann for whom the "Unconscious" became "God".

V.A. Kozhevnikov's book satisfies the indicated need. What it says about those critical moments experienced by Western European society, when compliance becomes a crime, we can also relate to ourselves. And our, that is, Eastern European, society is experiencing a critical moment in the last quarter of the century that is expiring. All the more reason to familiarize ourselves with the roots of the trend that has led us, like the entire West, to such a situation.

The French "fiunt" was transformed in the 18th century into the German "nascuntur": from creation and voluntary creativity they passed to a weak-willed and unconscious birth and development; evolution became the prevailing sympathy of the 19th century and the most suitable word to designate its general direction. But the meaning of evolution changes with the evolutionists themselves, and - the main thing! - in order to be convincing, in order to become truth and reality, evolution should have to give an obvious and tangible test of its theory of gradual and consistent development, actually restoring that past from which it derives the present, that chain of species and forms of life from which its present composition, its present organization, evolved. But to give such factual proof means to carry out the restoration of the past no longer in thought, not in a scientific hypothesis, not in Haeckel's fantastic genealogical tree of the animal-human race, but in a real, actual resurrection. This resurrection, moreover, not a private but a universal one, demands a universal unification for a universal cause, for universal knowledge, observation and experience. Only such unification leads to the reality of history, that is, to an organic connection of the present and the future with the past. At the same time, only such unification (not in thought, but in an absolutely universal cause) is the proper collectivism. The present collectivism, which has broken with the past in a hostile manner, full of hostility to the present, is groundless and powerless; that is why it does not give birth to a single history of united humanity, but only to a multitude of fantastic novels of the future; on the contrary, the natural cause is one; and whereas the artificial unification—socialism—the unification for the production of material things, can have a multitude of arbitrary solutions in its theory, sociology, the absolutely universal cause of universal salvation from destruction, which is necessary to all, allows only one single solution—resurrection. Returning from this digression, which explains what, if not everything, then the main thing, is, to Hamann, let us see in what this “prophet of the future,” as his 19th-century idol Goethe called him, sees “everything.” “In ‘Homo sum,’ says Hamann, “everything is given, everything is contained.” But in this loud aphorism, with its extreme vagueness, nothing is actually given, nothing is said, and nothing is contained. “Ecce homo!” (Behold the man!) expresses not a Christian, but a pagan view of Christ: it is a hypocritical expression of the regret of “the one in power,” and not the love of the one in power. Christ himself, calling himself “the Son of Man,” refutes Hamann with his vague, abstract humanism. Hamann’s “Omnia divina, sed et humana omnia!” is also untenable. *1 >> “Omnia divina” is just as vague in his work as “humana omnia.” To this we must also add the meaning of a small word that connects these expressions but separates their content: “sed” (but). With this “but” the Divine limits the human, and the human denies the Divine, and then, instead of “everything, omnia,” there remains “nothing, nihil,” and with his favorite motto Hamann, who fought so much against the negative tendencies of false rationalism, becomes the father of the new German Netovshchina. Hamann, it is true, loves the primitive, but not because it is paternal or ancestral, but because it is natural, self-born, “unconscious.” But the unconscious and the blind are precisely the “God” of Schopenhauer and Hartmann!.. So, without even realizing it, noticing, the optimist Hamann coincides with both future German pessimists, as if for the fact that under the cheerful he, “interested in everything,” was unable to notice the life-sorrowful. Despite all the long struggle of Hamann with the “impious” “Enlightenment” of the 18th century, Hamannism itself is, in essence, the same impious humanism, albeit with some peculiarities. If Italian humanism was antique, pagan, then the French was artificial, abstract, and the German was naturalistic, “natural” (it is not for nothing that not only Sturm und Drang <<*2" up to and including Goethe and Schiller, but also Kant considered Rousseau to be his ancestor!). The natural, the wild, the blind was taken for divine natural; love for the primitive was only imaginary, and love for the German was only pride: people for German humanism were, as for Rousseau, "sons of nature", and not sons of men.

To understand Hamann, who, according to Rocholl, "gave a program for the return of children's hearts to their fathers", two of the four epigraphs that precede V. Kozhevnikov's study of him would be enough. In these epigraphs, it is necessary to show his attitude, on the one hand, to the classical world, and on the other, to the biblical world, that is, to all history, to the entire past, or to the fathers. It is not enough to say that he loved history; for him it was everything, and he wanted to awaken love for it in his students, and through them in everyone, "as in sons", that is, he wanted to make real sons out of them.

For the first epigraph, relating to the ancient world, we must take the passage from Hamann's letter to Herder, where he speaks, unfortunately, in too many words about the need not to dissect the ancients or prepare mummies from them, but to restore, resurrect them.

For the "biblical" epigraph, we should take the following text: "The biblical tales are precious to him as chronicles of psychological development, that is, as chronicles of the human soul." The restoration of soul and body is history, that is, resurrection, although still mental, and not real.

If a third epigraph is needed, then nothing better can be chosen for it than the words borrowed from the prophet Ezekiel: "The field of history still seems strewn with dry bones; there is no breath of life in them; and the prophet speaks the words of the Lord to the wind of the desert alone."

Gaman, apparently, was still completely ignorant of both Indo-European and Zendo-Slavic antiquity; he also seemed to be ignorant of that vast land where there was no need to “return the hearts of sons to their fathers,” for there the cult of fathers was the basis of all life and all morality. We mean the world of the “yellow race,” China and Japan, where the Europeans are trying to introduce their Hamitic civilization, which turns the hearts of sons away from their fathers. If Gaman had known the Slavic and Chinese worlds, history would have appeared before him in a completely new light, would have received a different meaning and a different purpose. The view of Russia and the East on this meaning and this purpose, so different from the Western European view, is, of course, from the Western point of view, a primitive view, “backward” from the modern one. And why not! Despite all the depth of the imaginary world of metaphysics, despite all the charms of imaginary semblances of reality, this primitive view does not want to, cannot replace the real with an imaginary and genuine semblance. From the senile point of view of the West, this is, of course, a childish view; in fact, it is childish, infantile; and it was not in vain that it was said: "Be like children!" and it is precisely childhood that is set as the condition for entering the Kingdom of Heaven. It is precisely because of oblivion or misunderstanding of pure childhood love for parents and the duty that follows from it that all forms of supposed resurrection have proven untenable up to now. Biblical resurrection was asceticism, that is, not the return of the bodies of the dead, but the mortification of one's own body. The classical resurrection was Epicurean: forgetting the fathers, leaving them in decay, in pursuit of pleasure and beauty it “clung” to women, accelerating its path to decay as well.
