Three formulas: a) artistic: the unification of all created in the image of God the Creator, the unification of the re-creators (artists) for the re-creation of everything destroyed by the fault of people, everything left in the power of death and decay due to their inaction;
b) religious and moral: the unification of all living (sons) in the image of the Triune God of the fathers for the resurrection of the dead (parents); and
c) scientific: the unification of rational beings against the blind force of nature, deadly in its blindness, for its transformation into one governed by reason, and therefore life-giving.

By uniting all the arts in architecture, in the person of its most perfect creation - the temple as an image of the apparent universe, and by uniting all the sciences, all the knowledge in astronomy, which denies the apparent universe and embraces the earth with all its inhabitants in their present and past (paleontology and history) and all the worlds with all their properties, physical, chemical, we obtain the opposition between science and art, between science, which becomes Copernican, and art, which remains Ptolemaic.

The transition to reality consists in the destruction of the gap between science and art, between the image of the apparent universe (architecture, temple) and how it appears to thought, thinking or modern science. Art and poetry have remained true to the ancient Ptolemaic view of the world to this day, because the Copernican view of the world, they say, is "so unpoetic": for it there is no heaven, but only earth; it is as if it were created for a new prosaic, secular history.

The Copernican view is indeed unpoetic, but because it demands poetic creation in the real, and not in the metaphorical sense; it demands a reconciliation of science and art, which will only be accomplished in the realm of reality, when science and art will have the same material, when they will act with the same force and will make the very earths heavens. It is said of Ptolemaic art that there has never been a deception that elevates us more, for the anthropocentric position followed from the geocentric position. But how can the central position of man be reconciled with his actual impotence?.. By placing man in the center, the Ptolemaic system made him only a contemplator, and moreover a contemplator of his own insignificance; the world was represented here not as a blind force, but as a force controlled by reason, but by an inhuman reason. A blind force that carries within itself hunger, plagues, and death is understandable; but how can a rational force be combined with such disasters?! The Ptolemaic system pointed to man as a special object of the care of the Supreme Reason; but at the same time it would be a great mistake to think that the Supreme Reason was jealous of Its power and that man was doomed to eternal immaturity. But of course, human adulthood will not prevent the Supreme Reason from being omniscient, omnipotent, and doing everything for people, but doing it through them! In this is revealed the greatest greatness of God. The immortality of the soul, and moreover, innate and not acquired, was a necessity of this system. Rewards and punishments are acquired, and there is no place here for work, a common work, i.e., unification for resurrection, which, on the contrary, constitutes a necessity of the Copernican system, in which man is not placed in the center and does not serve as the goal of the universe. But this is precisely what compels man himself to bring expediency into the world, forces him himself to become the ruling force and make this introduction of expediency into the world the subject of a common cause. The Copernican system turns man from a contemplator into a doer, and sees a blind force in the world, recognizes the world as a blind force. The Copernican system is a hypothesis that can receive confirmation and full, tangible, demonstrative force only through the gradual and consistent resurrection of all previously living generations. These will be, as it were, testing expeditions to verify the truth of all the assumptions about the movement of worlds throughout the universe, their distance from one another, and in general everything that is included in this majestic hypothesis. Knowledge is proven by a universal cause, for knowledge, like faith, is the realization of what is desired, i.e. the demands of human nature. Science is proven by art: Copernican astronomy, which includes all sciences, is proven by celestial architecture, which embraces all the arts based on celestial mechanics, physics, chemistry, physiology, anthropology, and all history. This does not mean bringing the heavens down to the earth: it means raising the earth and all worlds to the highest, heavenly, governed by love, reason, or man as an instrument of the God of the fathers, the Triune God, the model of unanimity and agreement, the all-perfect Being. God, according to the Copernican system, is the Father, who not only does everything for people, but also through people, demanding, as the God of the fathers, from all living beings the unification for the resurrection of the dead and for the population of the worlds by the resurrected generations for the management of these latter. This will be the spiritualization of the worlds by the resurrected generations. The Copernican system for its moral completion requires the regulation of the worlds through the resurrection of baptized generations; it gives knowledge a goal, and makes art alive, perfect. No "deception that elevates us" can compare with the truth, which elevates us not imaginarily, but really.

Spiritualistic, dualistic philosophy is the product of the Ptolemaic or apparent universe, in which heaven is assigned to spiritual beings, and the earth to corporeal ones; whereas not only the New Testament, but also the Old Testament religion does not know this bifurcation, for the latter relates equally to "what is in heaven above" and to "what is on earth below"; and Christianity sees a better world not only in a new earth, but also in a new heaven, and not in the present ones, which must be destroyed or transformed, depending on whether repentance follows, and with it unification for the resurrection; if repentance does not follow, then the end will come, destruction...

The resolution of the contradiction between Copernican science and art, which still remains Ptolemaic, is therefore extremely important for life, because the Copernican worldview has this in common with the Christian worldview, that both are recognized as the highest truths, but, despite such recognition, neither one nor the other has penetrated life: the moral structure of the world remains pagan to this day, just as the Ptolemaic worldview continues to guide life to this day, to the point that astronomers themselves are forced to talk about the rising and setting of the sun, moon and stars. One might think that the moral structure of the world will become Christian only when not only thought, not only worldview, but art itself, i.e. deed, becomes Copernican.

Both art and science begin with the commandment "be like children." Only bereaved children, i.e. sons of dead fathers, lay the foundation for art or work. It is impossible to know the end (goal) of art without knowing its beginning, just as without knowing the end and goal, it is impossible to understand the meaning of art. Rise, rising, vertical position - this is the natural beginning of art, and this beginning indicates the goal and meaning of art. Together with the last sigh of the fathers, the gaze of the sons rose to heaven, as the bosom of fathers, not dead, but living, because only the living could they understand. Burying or even burning a dead father, the son, as a living being, immediately restored his father in the form of an image, as a living one, in an upright, standing position, and not lying down, as if dead. With the union of the sons, the monuments of the fathers were also united: a temple was created, which is the image of the earth giving up its dead. Stretching over the united monuments of the fathers a skin, a cover, a tent, like the sky, the sons painted the images of the fathers on this cover. And the temple became an image not only of the earth, giving up its dead, but also of the sky, inhabited by resurrected generations; the temple became an image of the apparent universe (according to the Ptolemaic system), a likeness, and not reality. What art, what temple, as a combination of all arts, should correspond to the Copernican worldview, which rejects the apparent universe and demands a real universe, inhabited not only by likenesses of the dead, but by the dead themselves? Only art can transform the Copernican hypothesis into an indubitable, tangible truth.

The temple, from its artistic side, expresses the pre-Copernican worldview, and from the technical side it represents the application of terrestrial mechanics, which boils down to one thing: to keeping bodies from falling. If the architecture of similitude is a counteraction to a fall, a lifting up, a support of the falling, a certain triumph over the fall of bodies, then real architecture will be a counteraction to the fall of the earth itself and the whole system, a counteraction to the fall of all world systems. For the earth, like all the heavenly bodies, strictly speaking, does not stand upright, but is constantly falling, making one, two, or even a very large number of circular revolutions. The sun itself, emitting rays, is condensed, cooled, and, consequently, its fall is intensified.

The relation of the supports to the parts they support, or the way in which the counteraction to the fall of bodies is produced, gives rise to all the diversity of styles and serves as their characteristic. A new style, i.e., a counteraction to the fall of the earth itself and of the heavenly bodies in general, can arise from the application of celestial mechanics to natural, celestial architecture; as much as the knowledge of the fall of bodies serves the art of construction, so too will celestial mechanics, celestial physics, etc., serve to convert the unconscious movements of the luminaries into conscious ones: they will serve to control them, to construct from them a solid building, a temple of worlds, moving irresistibly, without visible supports, in boundless space; they will serve to liberate all worlds from the bonds of gravity, from the blind force of attraction, making them an instrument for expressing mutual feelings, mutual love of all generations of the human race. Obviously, in this case the gap between architecture or the temple, combining all the arts, and astronomy, combining all the sciences, will be eliminated and complete unity will be established between them: architecture, combining all the arts, will become an experimental proof of astronomy, combining containing in itself all the sciences. It is no longer an artificial temple, not a representation of only the vault of heaven; it is not a round dance, a similitude to the movement of the sun: it is heaven itself, the movement of the earth itself, controlled by the thought and feeling of the harmonious choir of the entire human race. What unity would permeate the entire history of the human race from the first glance cast upon the sky by an ascended being, who arranged his earthly choir in the likeness of the heavenly movement, if this choir were then transformed from an imaginary sun-guide into a real amphibian!

A temple in general is a similitude of the universe, significantly lower than its original in reality, but incomparably higher in meaning. The meaning of the temple lies in the fact that it is a project of the universe in which everything that is dead in the original is revived, and where everything revived has become the consciousness and control of a being who was blind. A temple, even the most enormous, is small to the point of insignificance compared with the universe it depicts; but in this insignificance in size, the mortal, limited being strove to depict both distance and depth, and breadth, and the immense, boundless height, in order to establish in it everything that in blind nature appeared alive only for a moment. Man transformed this ephemeral existence in time into an ordinary (one-day) one in the speed of restoration, for the shorter the period of restoration, the more meaningful and broader it is in volume, containing within itself all the past. The son of man strove to depict immensity and power and life in the temple plastically, picturesquely, iconographically; he resorted to sound, to word, to writing, and, finally, in himself, in the living, he depicted the dead; and thus the collective prayer was transformed into a temple service. The resurrection of Christ was an ordinary (one-day) construction by Himself of the temple of His most pure body, and the ordinary construction of a temple, erected by common labor, without money, for a bloodless sacrifice - a temple similar, therefore, to the Jerusalem temple purified from blood and money (John, III, 16) - can and should be called a three-day one, and only then is the deep, pan-Christian meaning of these ordinary, and at the same time vowed temples revealed. The temple will be a three-day one if its construction, caused by some disaster, pestilence, suffering, begins on Friday evening and, having turned the rest of the Sabbath into labor, like the Son of Man, who healed the paralytic and raised Lazarus on the day of rest, ends with the consecration of the temple at midnight on the day of resurrection, i.e. at the beginning of the day of deliverance from suffering and death. Such significance, such meaning to the days of construction were apparently not given by the builders of ordinary churches themselves, although this is precisely the meaning and significance contained in them; here, one can say, is the whole essence of Christianity, which consists in the fact that the human race, fulfilling the will of the Father-fathers, identifying itself with it, itself suffering and dying, through a collective, multi-unit labor, in the image of the Triune, nevertheless achieves immortality and holiness.

The general resurrection is a complete victory over space and time. The transition "from earth to heaven" is a victory, a triumph over space (or successive omnipresence). The transition from death to life, or the simultaneous coexistence of the entire series of times (generations), the coexistence of succession, is a triumph over time. The ideality of these forms of knowledge (space and time) will become a reality. The general resurrection will become the unity of history and astronomy or the succession of generations in the totality, completeness, integrity of worlds. The transcendental (pre-experiential) aesthetics of space and time will become our real experience or common cause.
